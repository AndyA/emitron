Views including Oval Sculpture (Delos) (1955), Corinthos (1954-1955), and Construction (Crucifixion) (1966). Hepworth talks VO about being “basically and primarily a carver”, coming to work in metal only after thirty years of using other materials.

Medium and small sculptures, in a variety of materials including Infant (1929), Figure in Sycamore (1931), Torso (1932), Two Forms (1938), Group III (Evocation) (1952), Two Segments and Sphere (1935-1936), and Three Oblique Forms (February) (1967). Her VO describes their common features. Group I (Concourse) (1951) Three Personages (1965), Talisman II (1960). Vertical Forms (1965), and Image II (1960). Hepworth VO on the relationship of figures in groups, and the interplay of light when using marble which enables the expression of a feeling of contemplation. Hepworth describes VO how serravezza, a particular kind of Italian marble, is crystalline and changes colour depending on who carves it. Three Forms Vertical (Offering) (1967). Figure (Nyanga) (1959-1960), which she describes as “pleading”, a feeling created by form and material. Single Form (September) (1961), also in wood. Recurrent themes – the relationship between two forms, the oval, the group, the vertical form which, for her, resembles a human sentinel: Pierced Form (Toledo) (1957) and Two Personages (Menhirs) (1965). Rhythms are sensitive and subconscious. To achieve a particular rhythm for a whole piece require her to lock herself up for a day or wait for another time: Hollow Form with White Interior (1963) and Two Forms with White (Greek) (1963). Figure (Sunion) (1960), Sphere with Inner Form (1963): Hepworth’s fascination with the relationship between inner and outer forms, of a nut in its shell, of a child in the womb, etc. Oval Form (Trezion) (1961-1963) and Curved Form with Inner Form (Anima) (1959): Hepworth feels free to develop her responses to her own surroundings, being obsessed with the human response to life despite accusations that she is “puritanical, or cold, or geometric”.

Pieces from the 1930s and earlier: Mother and Child (1934), Large and Small Form (1934), Reclining Figure (1932), Contemplative Figure (1928), Sculpture with Profiles (1932).
