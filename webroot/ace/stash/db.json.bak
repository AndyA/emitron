There is that in the fact of Truth, though it be only in the nature of a single leaf, earnestly studied, which may have its share in the great labour of the world.” Commentary says that the Pre-Raphaelites wanted to return to a vision and “a truth to nature” that they believed English art had lost since the 15th century. William Holman Hunt’s 1848 Portrait of Dante Gabriel Rossetti who, in that year, suggested the “Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood”. Portrait of Holman Hunt by Rossetti (1848). Holman Hunt’s chalk portrait of John Everett Millais (1853). Rossetti’s sketches of Millais and Holman Hunt (c.1853). Various drawings and sketches. Face studies, intercut with paintings of the same for Lorenzo and Isabella (1849), from a poem by Keats. Sketches for and painting, Millais’s Christ in the House of His Parents (1850) which caused a scandal at the Royal Academy exhibition. Long quotation from The Times heard over. Sketches and painting for Mariana in the Moated Grange (1851); part of Tennyson’s poem (1830) read over. The Return of the Dove to the Ark (1851). John Ruskin’s encouraging letters to The Times brought more general approval. Millais’s portrait of John Ruskin (1853); Ruskin’s description heard over. Ruskin’s own drawing of the same rocks and river-bank. Commentary says that Ruskin approved of the Pre-Raphaelites because they put into practice his own ideas about “truth to nature”.

The Pretty Baa Lambs (1865) in which Ford used his wife, Emma as the model. Emma and Brown modelled for the figures in The Last of England (1855), described by Ford as being “in the strictest sense historical”, representative of the immigration movement. Like The Last of England, Work (1865) is an “essay in social comment”, the background of which shows Heath Street, Hampstead. Holman Hunt was a great adherent “to this principle of authenticity”, for example in his painting, A Converted British Family sheltering a Christian Priest from the Persecution of the Druids (1850), and “the originator of most of the ideas behind Pre-Raphaelite technique and practice”. Holman Hunt’s personal values led him towards Biblical subjects and moral tales: Claudio and Isabella (1849), Valentine Rescuing Silvia from Proteus (The Two Gentlemen of Verona) (1851), The Hireling Shepherd (1851) (commentary quotes from Ezekiel xxxiv 2-16 about prophesying against the shepherds), Our English Coasts (Strayed Sheep) (1852), The Scapegoat (1854), The Light of the World (1881) (John viii 12). \u000b\u000b ACE012.4 10:18:55 10:28:56 The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple (1860).

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE018.2 10:00:00 10:08:39 The National Gallery of Scotland. Sir Anthony Blunt sitting beside painting. The paintings shown in order, Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Ordination, Marriage, Extreme Unction. Blunt’s VO gives information on genesis of the series. Painted between 1644 and 1648 at the behest of Paul Fréart de Chantou who wanted copies of an earlier series. Blunt considers these paintings to represent the quintessence of Poussin’s art. He believes that Poussin connected these elements of the Christian faith with the Greek Mysteries. Details of Extreme Unction in which Roman and Christian symbols are combined. Details of Eucharist. The painting shows the participants reclining in the Roman manner, an early Christian tradition of holding the Eucharist bread in their hands, and Christ resembling an early Classical god, and alludes to Christ’s washing of the Apostles’ feet. Details of Penance which illustrates the washing of the feet of Simon the Pharisee by a servant, and the feet of Christ by Mary Magdalene, and makes reference to elements of early Christian liturgy. ACE018.3 10:08:39 10:19:31 Details of Confirmation, which has many more allusions to early Christian liturgy, including the practice, taken over from Judaism, of asperging converts with hyssop. Blunt says that one detail of early dress is incorrect in colour, but that Poussin would generally have had to use sarcophagus reliefs as his source (illustrated by one from St. John Lateran, Rome). Another early Christian sarcophagus which may have been the inspiration for some elements of Ordination. An early sketch for the painting.

The paintings shown in order, Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Ordination, Marriage, Extreme Unction. Blunt’s VO gives information on genesis of the series. Painted between 1644 and 1648 at the behest of Paul Fréart de Chantou who wanted copies of an earlier series. Blunt considers these paintings to represent the quintessence of Poussin’s art. He believes that Poussin connected these elements of the Christian faith with the Greek Mysteries. Details of Extreme Unction in which Roman and Christian symbols are combined. Details of Eucharist. The painting shows the participants reclining in the Roman manner, an early Christian tradition of holding the Eucharist bread in their hands, and Christ resembling an early Classical god, and alludes to Christ’s washing of the Apostles’ feet. Details of Penance which illustrates the washing of the feet of Simon the Pharisee by a servant, and the feet of Christ by Mary Magdalene, and makes reference to elements of early Christian liturgy.",

He was then in his sixtieth year. During the three winters of 1899-1901 he stayed at the Savoy Hotel, in a fifth floor room overlooking the Thames. He chose three subjects for this series, two of which he could paint from the balcony of his room.” View from the Savoy. Caption: “Upstream was CHARING CROSS BRIDGE with Westminster in the background.” View from the Savoy. Caption: “downstream was WATERLOO BRIDGE.” Houses of Parliament. Caption: “From St Thomas’s Hospital, across the river, he painted his third motif, THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, WESTMINSTER.” Caption: “With about 100 canvases he returned to France and worked on them in the studio for another three years. Of these, 37 were exhibited in Paris in May 1904. The series is now scattered in public and private collections throughout the world.” Film of the Houses of Parliament from St Thomas’s; painting of the same view.

King at work, preparing a grid on paper. His VO talking about his sculpture, Open Bound (1973), and about how he uses the grid, in this case, with the idea of a honeycomb in mind and forming a conical shape. “A grid transformed into matter” – 3-D plaster model. The finished Open Bound. Driving on a motorway. King’s VO says that “necessity has made [him] seek out a studio in the country”, and that the drive gives him time to think and to observe nature. Arriving at the studio, a farm outbuilding. The grid. A model, in thin metal, of the intended work. Shaping and bending metal plates. King’s VO says that after Open Bound, there was less need than usual to make a model for his next piece which would “be about linkages, and spread, and continuity”. He says he enjoys the physicality of sculpture which can often take his mind off problems of a work “that isn’t going right”. Welding. VO says the work only begins to involve him when it begins to take shape. ACE047.3 10:08:57 10:20:33 Further stages in construction. King’s VO says that it was looking at “certain parts of Open Bound, where it hits the ground” that inspired his current piece, these being “a layer of wood, a layer of mesh, wood again, then two layers of mesh next to each other, then wood, mesh, and wood again”. His VO describes his intentions, saying that colour would help distinguish between the layers, and talking about the effects of the different levels, the use of mesh, and tilting the panels. Further stages in construction. King’s VO talking about colour, both natural and applied, how this affects the light on the object and the perception of form, and how it can give impetus to altering a work. Cutting away a piece of mesh. King’s VO talking about the function of the metal plates. He says that the need to paint some of the plates before the construction was completed meant that colour became dominant early on and altered the way in which he saw the work and caused a number of problems in the final stages. Views of the sculpture, Open (red blue) Bound (1973) outside the studio.

Details of ceiling paintings while Martin wonders why he is alone there, and why these paintings aren’t better appreciated. Portrait from ceiling of King James I; Martin points out that he wanted the Monarchy to take precedence over the House of Commons, and was thus against democracy. Engraving showing the Commons around 1628; the Petition of Right. More details from paintings. Martin believes that the decoration in the Banqueting House challenges the British ideal, and “has come to represent a dead idea”. Charles I, King of England, from Three Angles (The Triple Portrait) by Anthony van Dyck (c.1636). Engraving of London Bridge. Rubens’s portrait of Thomas Howard, 2nd Earl of Arundel and Surrey (1629). Arundel admired Rubens and inspired others to commission work from him. Portrait of Charles I of England (1631) by Daniel Mytens (1631). A painting which Rubens gave to Charles, Minerva Protects Pax from Mars (Peace and War) (1629-1630); Martin talks about details of the painting in which Rubens used “a vocabulary of allegory and symbol … common to everybody that was educated in the classical tradition”, explaining that Minerva personified wisdom, Hercules could personify strength, etc. He suggests that Rubens wanted to say to Charles that, as a wise man, he would favour peace over war, but did it in a way which had “drama … impact and relevance”. Part of Rubens’s Landscape with St George and the Dragon (1629-1635) with Charles I as the Saint and Queen Henrietta Maria as the princess. Martin points out that the picture also shows the Thames and Lambeth Palace. Rubens’s oil sketch of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham (1625). Painting, Minerva and Mercury conduct the Duke of Buckingham to the Temple of Virtue (c.1625). Martin explains the allegory and compares it to The Apotheosis of James I, the centrepiece of the Banqueting Hall ceiling. General view of the Banqueting Hall. The Peaceful Reign of James I (aka The Benefits of the Reign of James I), with Minerva repulsing Mars while James embraces Concord and Peace. The Union of the Crowns, in which James directs Minerva to present the crowns of England and Scotland to Charles I, while Hercules overcomes Evil. Martin compares the Hercules figure to that of Cain Killing Abel (c.1540) by Titian, shown as engraving. Rubens’s coat of arms. Details of canvases showing joins where sections were sewn together. Self portrait c.1638-1640. Details of paintings. Martin points out that there were very few working drawings but many oil sketches, probably used by studio assistants to help them in blocking in the large canvases while Rubens went over them later. The paintings were delivered and installed in 1635. Rubens’s painting, An Autumn Landscape with a View of Het Steen in the Early Morning (c.1636), of his country house at Elewijt, where he spent most of his last year before his death in 1640. Self Portrait. Edward Bower’s portrait of Charles I at His Trial (1648). Engraving of crowds. Engraving of Oliver Cromwell with head of executed king; Cromwell’s signature on execution order.

Spinning cotton thread by hand; early spinning wheels. Demands of a growing population required a faster method. A “spinning Jenny”, invented by James Hargreaves, which enabled sixteen spindles to be handled simultaneously. Improvements in machinery, the “spinning frame” devised by Richard Arkwright, enabled unskilled workers to operate it. Arkwright joined with Jedediah Strutt, in Nottingham, and their business expanded to the point where they set up a water-powered mass production system at Cromford, Derbyshire. Water mill wheels. Engraving of the Lombe brothers’ silk mill at Derby, prototype of many mill buildings; engraving of mechanical functions. Long narrow factory room designed to accommodate large machines and provide ample natural light. Arkwright’s mill at Cromford. Advertisement for jobs there. Carding machine. Engraving of women working on such equipment; a spinning frame, operated by children. Painting of the mill. North Street, part of the workers’ housing built by Arkwright at Cromford; other buildings there. Willersley Castle, Arkwright’s own house. Commentary talks about social improvements made by Arkwright, who fostered the image of workers as “a happy family, labouring for their benevolent employer”. Houses, machinery, engravings; VO singing an eighteenth century tribute to Arkwright’s methods at “the cotton mills now at Cromford”.

One can commiserate with or hope to transform the men and women who have lost their mental equilibrium in the vortex of modern life, but I do not believe that to decorate their homes with traditional gables and dormers helps them in the least. On the contrary: this only widens the gap between appearance and reality …” Apartment buildings, houses, interior design details. “Our investigations into housing and town planning problems have been based on the needs of the community… I believe that work of this kind leads to material advances which have nothing to do with politics… There is no hard and fast formula for doing this or that in the new architecture… For even living organisms like animals and plants can all be realised against a stark plain surface of a wall.” Multi-panelled stained glass window representing yacht under sail.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE056.2 10:00:00 10:07:00 Noise of ocean. Caption: “Consider the Eskimo who, with visibility zero, navigates his kayak along dangerous coastlines. He is guided by the feel of the wind and the smell of the fog, by the sound of the surf and nesting birds, and particularly by the feel of the pattern of the waves and currents against his buttocks. – Edmund Carpenter.” Commentary: “I was born without a skin, all the pores open and breathing; the softness, the warmth and the smells; the whole body invaded, penetrated, responding. Every tiny cell and pore active and trembling and enjoying. I shrieked with pain!” Newly born baby with mother and hospital staff; baby’s cries echoed by soprano singer. Baby. Title and credits over film of baby sleeping and being caressed by mother. London traffic. Commentary: “Gold. The work of men’s hands. Their idols are silver and gold. The work of men’s hands. They have mouths but they speak not. They have ears, but they hear not. Noses they have, but they smell not. They have hands, but they handle not. Feet they have, but they walk not. Neither speak they through their throat.” [Psalm 115]. Children playing in woods; leaves, insects, etc. Commentary: “I see all, am all, all. I leap along the line of the horizon hill. I am a cloud in the high sky. I trace the vein of implicate foe. I am bird world, leaf life. I am wasp world hung under low-belly branch of hidden form. Friable paper world, humming with hate. Moss thought, rain thought, stone still thought on the hill. Never, never, never will I go home to be a child.” Inside a car manufacturing plant. Typist. Commuters going down stairs. ACE056.3 10:07:00 10:12:56 R D Laing is asked “How important is it to you to be aware of your senses and emotions, your feelings?” and replies that it is “of supreme importance… to be aware of ourselves…” Commuters on packed Underground train. The camera obscura above the Avon Gorge, Clifton. R L Gregory shows how it works, and explains that vision works “by decoding … electrical signals”, and that other senses function similarly via transducers. He says that his lapel microphone is also a transducer, in which sound signals to the microphone are converted to electrical currents – wave representations of his words shown – which are decoded by the brain. Gregory (intercut with images of the ear, of people touching each other, kissing, etc.) talks about the sensitivity of sense organs, and the difficulty of ascribing “meaning” to the experiences of the world occasioned by their stimulation. He proposes a way of analysing this by analogy with the elements of a novel: some derive from reality and some do not, and it can be dangerous “if the fictions get out of gear with reality”. Optical illusion of hollow cube created by electronic signal. A simulated Penrose triangle which Gregory demonstrates. Laing says that people can only experience the world directly through their own senses; everything else is “inference”.\u000b\u000b ACE056.4 10:12:56 10:22:15 Caption: “Literacy ushered man into the divided world of the senses ... [Man] became aware of his body only in sports and sex, and sometimes not even then. – Edmund Carpenter.” A therapy group (International Saturday Group) led by Nadine Scott: Laing says that thousands of people are “agonised” because they have now “lost their feelings…” and want to know how they can “get in touch with [their] senses”. He believes there is “a fear” of feelings and of the senses, and of being out of control. Therapy group continues. Laing says (part VO) that such unusual techniques can help to release people from their pain but adds that there is no system on offer for coping with life afterwards. He believes that it’s more important that people are not deprived of “the normal, natural functions of a happy, full, satisfying social life…” and says he prefers singing to screaming or roaring. \u000b\u000b ACE056.5 10:22:15 10:31:38 Elkie Brooks recording Like a Rolling Stone. David Hockney at Glyndebourne. Commentary: “The eye – it cannot choose but see; we cannot bid the ear be still. Our bodies feel, where’er they be, against or with our will.” [William Wordsworth Expostulation and Reply, 1798]. Sets and props for The Magic Flute; Hockney sketching new ideas. He says “it’s good to follow the senses … to trust … intuition” but many people find this difficult. Sets being erected, etc. His VO talks about learning to draw at “a very old-fashioned art school” which was good because it made him look at things “very, very carefully”. Hockney talks about wearing glasses. Glyndebourne audience picnicking. Hockney on “imaginative use of the senses”. He believes that many people use drugs to give themselves a sense of adventure; those in authority who want to ban drugs don’t recognise that they get their own adventures from that activity.\u000b\u000b ACE056.6 10:31:38 10:38:58 Arthur Balaskas (naked) performing yoga exercises on Silbury Hill, with thermal imaging views of his body as it moves. Commentary: “I sing the body electric … O I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul, O I say now these are the Soul! [Lines from Walt Whitman’s “I Sing the Body Electric” (Leaves of Grass, 1900)]. Balaskas performing cartwheels intercut with shots of female gymnast on asymmetric bars, cheetah chasing gazelles. Joseph Beuys, holding a mouse, says he believes in a level of existence “higher” than that of humans, in invisible powers co-operating with human beings as in old myths and fairy tales, etc. Black and white film of Beuys squashing a lump of fat behind his knees; contemporary footage and VO explaining his Eurasienstab action (first performed 1967), shown in black and white – of investigating “the unknown senses”, using a bent copper rod to seek “power” in the “outer world”. Views of the Lovell radio-telescope at Jodrell Bank. Commentary: “With clarity and quiet I look upon the world and say, All that I see, hear, taste, smell, and touch are the creations of my mind … The mind shouts: ‘Only I exist! Deep in my subterranean cells my five senses labor; they weave and unweave space and time, joy and sorrow, matter and spirit.’” [From The Saviors of God – Spiritual Exercises by Nikos Kazantzakis] \u000b\u000b ACE056.7 10:38:58 10:45:03 Michael Tippett talking about the genesis of his Symphony No.3 while listening to music at the Edinburgh Festival; the notes he’s made on his ideas; playing phrases on the piano (part of performance heard over); the score. He says the music is “not about the sensations of the external world, but about the intimations, intuitions, dreams, the fantasies, the feelings, particularly the feelings of our inner experience…” and talks about the mystifying process of transmuting external experience into sound. He says that “we want our souls to be nourished and unless they are nourished, we are dead.” ACE056.8 10:45:03 10:48:46 Waves on seashore. Micro-photography of sperm and egg, and cell division; Laing’s VO saying “we are alive all the way from that very first cell…”; Earth from space, flowing lava, development of the embryo, etc. Commentary: “I grew immersed in natural waters, like the mollusc in green phosphorescence. In me sounded the crusty salt forming my singular skeleton. How to explain. Almost without the blue and bitter movement of breathing, one by one the waves repeated what I sensed and trembled with, until the salt and the spray formed me.” Extracts from In the Land of the War Canoes (1914) showing Kwakiutl dancers. ACE056.9 10:48:46 10:58:33 Embryo. Laing (part VO) explaining why he puts “great importance on these first nine months in the womb”, and on other “firsts”. Laing and two women helping a third, his wife, Jutta Werner, with home birth. He says that “the most important single component of the environment of human beings is other human beings…” and wants his children “to have open access” to the world of “the sky and the air and the earth and the sea and the water and the sun and the moon and the stars...”. Werner breast-feeding baby, watched by older children and Laing, who talks about babies, etc., as it falls asleep. Credits.

Actors performing roles of elderly people, explaining how they spend their time. Audience. Actors dance to busker’s music. Busker introduces the Company, gives the name of the play, No Sheep on the Bush, and explains that it was written after conversations with a number of older people in Hammersmith, and “with those who work with and for them”. Director, Chattie Salaman, talking about developing the play with the actors. Improvisation/rehearsal – a couple at home. Other members of the company critique what they’ve seen.

The world will destroy itself as everybody wants power; there was more respect for others when she was young. She talks about her mother, about her children. ACE060.4 10:16:50 10:27:27 Company discusses content of show. Salaman is not happy with the way things are going. Various suggestions as to how they should proceed. One actor proposes they should each say what they think about old people in Britain. Writer says there’s no point in including large quantities of statistics. Argument about how to “use” the fact that one of the actors is black. ACE060.5 10:27:27 10:34:24 Writer talking about the difference between the way he works and how the company operates. Elderly women talking and singing. Elderly woman canteen helper interviewed at home talks about the difference in attitude to people of 60 when she was young and now. Sixty used to be thought of as “old age”, but she now considers it young. She believes that mixing with younger people helps older ones feel young. The sing-song continues. Rehearsal: man has just come home after his retirement party. Man in his seventies saying he would have liked to have had children but wasn’t “the marrying type”. ACE060.6 10:34:24 10:43:23 Rehearsal: social worker worrying about woman not using her fire. Performance: busker singing. Man talks about having been compulsorily retired and being unable to get any sort of work because of being 70. Performance: after the retirement party. First woman talking about her late husband and how he died; she doesn’t feel lonely because of her pets and her friends. Performance: woman and her dead husband. Woman continues to talk about her husband’s death. Performance: woman with her dead husband; dressed mourning. Woman canteen helper describes how she felt about the death of her husband, and how she felt it was best to “get up and go”.

Man’s daughter is shocked. Finale. Audience members talk about their reactions to the play. One thinks it should be shown to younger people rather than pensioners; some think older people haven’t made enough fuss and need to organise together. Salaman says that old age is something that has frightened her and she hoped she’d be able to deal with it in this way. She is also interested in how younger actors can portray older people without actually imitating them. She thinks this is also an interest of writer, though most English people have come from a realistic theatrical tradition. Woman singing “Love is Like a Violin” to other club members. Credits.",

Phillips talks about “bill toge”, the hero of his book, who now appears throughout his book, the theme of which is unrequited love with “a glimmer of hope”. Phillips talks about the book – an inexhaustible source – which he started using in 1966 and is still working with ten years later. He’s used other copies of the book to make related works, including a series of paintings called The Quest for Irma (1973), and a poster for the National Theatre (1975).

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE074.2 10:00:00 10:07:35 Artist; little girl pressing her hand on painted hand. People painting wall; gathering in front of mural in Floyd Road, Charlton. VO saying that “Art students tend to be idealistic. They say things like, ‘We must keep going, we must keep on producing art.’ The discussion of ‘who for?’ doesn’t occur… Now … we are inclined to think that possibly galleries are the wrong place to show … and they’re showing to the wrong people…” Images of a variety of public murals in London. Artist’s VO saying that the chance to paint murals offered the chance to get out of the studio, and out of the “gallery situation”: Peter Pelz’s Ascension mural on St Hugh’s, Charterhouse-in-Southwark. Another VO over view of the Morgan’s mural says it’s the doing of the painting that’s important. Russell Barrett working on his White City Estate Pop Heroes project, with portrait of James Dean and images of comic book figures. Mural under Westway as artists push scaffold into position; Emily Young’s VO talking about mural art being without commercial bias: Young on scaffold working on the mural. Mill Lane bridge; man talking about the first mural painted on it (1971); Marie Richman’s VO saying that the current bridge project is being done by the four-person West Hampstead Mural Workshop, leaving empty spaces for local people to add their own images; she introduces herself, and Geoff Richman, seen in mirror with Caroline Goldie and Ron Orders. Bricklaying. ACE074.3 10:07:35 10:12:38 Factory. Members of BRAG, the Battersea Redevelopment Action Group, formed to fight Morgan Crucible Company’s redevelopment plans for the Battersea riverfront, wanting “planning for local people, for Battersea working class people”, demonstrating in Battersea Church Road, as shareholders arrive for the company’s AGM. Battersea Bridge; the riverfront and nearby buildings. Man painting the words Wandsworth Mural Workshop on wall. People on scaffold outside Morgan’s, painting the exterior wall white, as Morgan’s themselves had refused to do. Brian Barnes’s VO saying that, following “making it more attractive” in this way, he decided to paint a mural on the 256ft x 18ft wall, and describes the process of researching and painting a picture, to which local people contributed, which he considers had political and artistic significance. Bricklaying. ACE074.4 10:12:38 10:18:38 Tower blocks and other buildings the Milton Court estate, New Cross; residents’ VOs talking about lack of leisure facilities, and their feelings about living there. Murals by the 395 Association; man painting. Mural of tiger in ring of flames and smoke. Other artists at work. One of the group (of five) talking about the project, begun in 1975, when they opened a studio on the estate and invited older people to participate in producing paintings for their flats, and then extended into mural work. The artist discussing what they’re doing. Views of buildings and murals; residents’ VOs commenting on the work, some positively, some otherwise. Bricklaying. ACE074.5 10:18:38 10:27:10 Progress on the wall at Morgan’s, with Barnes and others – including Labour politician Tony Belton – at work; his VO explains that this is their first large mural and the experience helps them develop their skills. He feels it is important that the local community be involved. Images from the “bad” side [the mural was eventually known both as the Battersea Mural and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] include representation of Garton’s Glucose Factory and Tate & Lyle’s “Mr Cube”, some luxury flats built on a site sold cheaply by the Conservative council, and Mickey Mouse. Images from the “good” side” include recreational activities, house building, and portraits of local people. Barnes’s VO describes the images. Bricklaying. ACE074.6 10:27:10 10:36:21 Peter Pelz painting on the wall of a petrol station. VO says “Mural painting gives the artist … an opportunity of creating something that has a ‘place’ and is related to the surroundings...” Ornately painted organ with organist playing. People paintings at Art Club; mural portraits painted by members. Pelz with students in his art class in Clapham; VO talks about how people need to “see”, and how they work with colour, etc.; class members talking about what they do, and how Pelze helps them. Buildings on the South Bank – Hayward Gallery, etc. – and nearby office blocks. Murals. The same sequence of shots seen on editing table. Pelz talking about his responses to the “oppressiveness” of the wall alongside car park on which he painted a long mural. The Ascension mural in Bermondsey. More from the South Bank mural; Pelz’s VO says that his work is about “freedom … attitudes of freedom”, and describes himself as a “visionary painter, rather than a technical painter”, and gives voice to people’s “distress”. Bricklaying. ACE074.7 10:36:21 10:46:55 View of mural covering the entire face of the end of a run of shops. VO saying that using such a space can mean that to “assess the quality a work of art” relating to its size. Outside Charlton Athletic football ground. Derelict terraced houses. Floyd Road: painting mural showing lots of people resisting demolition and building and decorating houses; VOs of members of Greenwich Mural Workshop talking about the process of discussion, design and execution, all of which involved local people, “not the traditional activities of the artist”, and the use of “art politically”. Woman from GMW announces street party to celebrate completion of mural and introduces Deputy Mayor Dick Neave to cut the ribbon. Scenes at the party, including artists helping children make masks, a Punch and Judy show, etc. GMW VOs talking about the importance of the party; suggesting that painting in public serves to demystify the process, and saying how important group activities are.

Plays piano which he says is “the place where all [his] music starts…”, and describes how improvisation at the piano is how he arrives at ideas for themes and orchestration. He is currently working on a setting of a William Blake poem, The Fields of Islington. Recording orchestrated version of The Fields. Westbrook’s VO talks about working with a regular small group, augmented on this occasion; though he likes having more musicians, he worries about using big band orchestration too much. ACE075.3 10:08:14 10:15:20 In the recording studio. Westbrook and his Brass Band (formed around 1973) at his house, playing Wheel of Fortune; his VO says that despite being best known for large orchestrated works, most of what he’s done has been for smaller groups. He says that there is a good deal of freedom for the individual musicians, but they must work well together. His VO talks about the Brass Band evolving from a street band into a concert group. The Band playing out of doors in order to help attract an evening audience and to bring the music to a wider audience. Westbrook’s VO talking about this being a long-standing jazz tradition, and says that people enjoy hearing music in, e.g., shopping centres. Bartlemy Fair performed in a variety of indoor and outdoor locations. ACE075.4 10:15:20 10:22:04 Band members at airport, driving, playing traditional jazz number; band members’ VOs talking about touring, about Westbrook’s willingness to take a chance and his abilities as a composer, etc. Westbrook playing Tender Love on guitar in his back garden, writing music, etc; his VO says American jazz has always been “a tremendous influence”, though he has used it to develop his own originality. He says it is customary to perform a series of “well known jazz classics” to acknowledge the debt he and his musicians owe to this tradition. Kate Westbrook introduces God Bless the Child in French; her VO talking about the organic growth of their music, and about Westbrook’s attitude towards the successes of individual musicians. Westbrook playing his Piano Link.\u000b\u000b ACE075.5 10:22:04 10:34:38 Westbrook at piano at same event, and group in dressing room; his VO names it as the “Brass Band and Cabaret” to suggest that its work is broader than just jazz, and that each individual musician is also a performer. Westbrook introduces (in French) Berthold Brecht and Kurt Weill’s Der Kanonen-Song; his VO talks about this as being “an ideal vehicle” for the Band. Westbrook says he’s found it interesting to reinterpret another composer’s material rather than write his own, particularly as he can bring it up to date. Performance continues; Westbrook’s VO points out that, because the finale is improvised, each performance emphasises something different. Westbrook says that, in addition to working with show tunes as many others do, the Band uses traditional English words and music such as Lady Howard’s Coach, a West Country song in which “Lady Howard” is another name for Death. The Band performing and recording this. ACE075.6 10:34:38 10:42:28 Westbrook says that the most important things for him are to be able to carry on with his own music, using whatever musicians he needs, and to try “to push the music into new areas”. He talks about using different instrumentations, the variety offering a challenge and helping him maintain his own identity. VO continues over Band performing I See Thy Form.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE078.2 10:00:00 10:11:34 Golders Green Unitarian Church. Reverend Keith Gilley quotes e e cummings, “the magical hour when is becomes if”, saying that all church services are about “the attempt to make ‘is’ into ‘if’”, and that that’s what the Phantom Captain tried to do as well. The Phantom Captain entering church to organ accompaniment. Neil Hornick talks about how The Phantom Captain had to become a religious cult, and the development of the service, “Secretions” (or the “Secret Service”), for The First Church of the Phantom Captain Reformed. The “service”. Preacher talking about St Augustine and God. Different kinds of smiling and laughter. Peter Godfrey says that The Phantom Captain tried to work “in the area between theatre and reality” but he was prepared to see the show as a genuine religious service. Performance: Personal Testimony. Navigator Bright saying he’s given up drink and drugs. Hornick says that the work was more than “a surrealist joke”, “an authentic expression of what we hold sacred”, humour. Rescue introduces Navigator coming “face to face with the unknown”. Woman in white with goldfish bowl. “Simple Secretions for beginners.” “Doubts and Heresies.” “Navigator C healed of Sea Sickness.” ACE078.3 10:11:34 10:21:36 The Phantom Captain’s Waiter Service. Paging “Mr Jordan” who takes a phone call about trying to stop an experimental nuclear reactor blowing up. Customers are encouraged to order from the “menu of intriguing experiences”. Waiters and waitresses singing. “Party Atmosphere.” “Abject Apologies.” “Auto-Eroticism.” Joel Cutrara says if they really know what they were doing, they wouldn’t – and couldn’t – be doing it. Hornick talks about “infiltration work” in everyday situations in which they are not immediately identified as actors. Pretending to be foreign tourists at Jubilee celebrations. Hornick shows and talks about the “Tilburg Pissing Bottles” presented to The Phantom Captain when they performed there in 1976. The First Church of the Phantom Captain Reformed. Navigator Bright singing “Sail on, My Captain”. The Phantom Captain on board ship. ACE078.4 10:21:36 10:31:23 De Lantaren Theatre, Rotterdam. Poster for the Ungelukkige Liefde Festival (Tragic Love Festival). Theatre interior. Peter Deman talks about their Festival piece, The Narcissus Complex. Extracts from performance. More interaction: Cast, dressed in night clothes and carrying candles, on the concourse and platforms at Waterloo station. Young man describes a mock inaugural ceremony at Brunel University, at which The Phantom Captain, pretending to be staff, addressed new students. Hornick addressing “the unconscious” of a group of toys. Deman with snowstorm globe. ACE078.5 10:31:23 10:42:05 Hornick says that they sometimes create environments and social situations which the audience “passes through” rather than attending a conventional stage show. He describes The Investigation Bureau. Excerpts. Gilley talks about the performances being open-ended and questioning, and likens them to any kind of belief system or lifestyle which “begins with some kind of doubting”.

He credits Heartfield with being the founder of “epic theatre”. Man in theatre. “The plain man of the seventies and eighties sees the theatre as a temple of the muses, to be entered in a white tie and tails and a mood of appropriate elation.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE081.2 10:00:00 10:08:30 Newsreel footage of VE-Day celebrations; commentary says that in “the new Britain” everyone was to have “the opportunity to develop a richer and fuller life”. The Arts Council of Great Britain was formed to build on the work of the wartime Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA) (Graham Sutherland’s Devastation, 1941: An East End Street (1941) and Paul Nash’s Dead Sea (1940-1941); its chairman, Maynard Keynes, believed that once poverty had been eliminated from society, and there would be “freedom for the mass of people to enjoy fine art”. Newsreel footage of elections; women in factories; furnaces; Winston Churchill; radio announcement of Labour’s election victory; Clement Attlee; harvesting potatoes; children playing; Piccadilly Circus. Commentary quotes “by the provision of concert halls, modern libraries, theatres and civic centres, we desire to assure our people full access to the great cultural heritage of this nation”. Benjamin Britten at the piano; photographs from his opera, Peter Grimes. Music from opera over panning shot of Sadlers Wells Theatre where it played to a “privileged” audience. Footage of people in poor housing condition where “a painting on the wall was low down on the list of requirements”. Commentary refers to article in Picture Post, in which young artists were quoted and some of their works reproduced (Leonard Rosoman: “All good painting is non-realistic to some degree. Imitation is not the aim.” Patrick Heron: “The greatest painters of our age have been preoccupied with the problem of form rather than content.” Robert MacBryde: “It is the painter’s function to explore and demonstrate the interdependence of forms. I paint the permanent reality behind the passing instant.” Robert Colquhoun over Man and Horse: “Each painting is a kind of discovery of new forms, colour relations, or balance in composition.”) and says that readers were “incensed” and quotes from their letters to the magazine. Colquhoun’s Woman in a Blue Hat (1947); photograph of Prunella Clough. Commentary suggests that “artist and public were talking about two different experiences”, the artists “describing the organisation of paint on canvas” while the public were trying to “see through the canvas” to “the truth” of the picture. Newsreel shots of crowds on beach (August Bank Holiday, 1945), and film of exploding atomic bomb over Hiroshima. Francis Bacon’s Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (c.1944). \u000b\u000b ACE081.3 10:08:30 10:17:17 Soldiers being demobilised, going home, theatre exterior, officer handing out bananas. \u000bPrefabricated houses being transported and constructed; rows of prefabs still standing in the 1970s: woman inhabitant interviewed. Commentary suggests their continuing existence is an indictment of post-war building policy. Film of families moving as squatters into empty army camps; the short-lived, September, 1941, occupation of empty luxury flats in Kensington. The “Britain Can Make It” exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum: house interiors, clothes, portable radios, garden furniture, etc. Commentary talks about the “unique and daring experiment” of the introduction of the Third Programme, intended to bring culture into the home via radio, but which “contributed to a further polarisation of culture” because of its “upper-class tone”. Children in new school buildings. Commentary asks if more education “would help bridge the gap between the artist and his public” but quotes from Cecil Collins’s Vision of the Fool, “We are all being educated to believe in the extrovert, useful person. Why? Because the extrovert, useful person is the most exploitable type… The Fool is interested in life, not in power, nor the passing of examinations…” Head of a Fool (1949) and another painting by Collins. Market traders explaining what their views on “art”. Erecting statues. Commentary wonders if Socialist-Realism would be effective in Britain. Unveiling (1948) William Reid Dick’s statue of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Grosvenor Square: “if this isn’t art, it does imply an attitude to art”. Film of Dick working on the statue. Film of the difficulties unveiling (1949) Dick’s statue of Lady Godiva in Coventry. \u000b ACE081.4 10:17:17 10:27:52 St Matthew’s Church, Northampton, where Canon Walter Hussey commissioned Madonna and Child (1944) by Henry Moore and The Crucifixion (1946) by Graham Sutherland. Commentary points out that commissions such as these are rare and that large-scale works are more often found in museums than in public places. Post-war purchases by the Tate Gallery: Origins of the Land (Sutherland, 1951), Trafalgar Square (Ceri Richards, 1950), Girl with a White Dog (Lucian Freud, 1951-1952), Street and Railway Bridge (John Minton, 1946), Eduardo Paolozzi’s Two Forms on a Rod (1948-1949), Jacob Epstein’s Lucifer (1944-1945) in Birmingham City Art Gallery: Commentary identifies the issue of whether or not contemporary art should “be part of people’s daily environment”. People going to work in industrial town. Coal mine. Scenes of nationalisation events (January 1st, 1947). Three paintings by Josef Herman, a rare example of an artist coming from a working-class community. Scenes during the severe winter of 1946-1947 which caused breakdown in coal distribution; subsequent floods. Industrial scenes, shipyards, etc.; women queuing for food; house-building. Prototype mass-produced houses of different designs – Orlit, BISF, Airey, etc. – an experiment which failed because the market was insufficiently centralised to keep costs down. Commentary suggests that “… no truly progressive society can afford to repress the individual’s need to be different”. Woman talking about personalising her house as she “wouldn’t want it like everybody else’s”. Interior of pre-fab where owners, Mr and Mrs England, show off all the models and other ornaments they’ve made themselves. Commentary asks whether “if everyone created things in their spare time … they’d understand modern art any better”. Newsreel coverage of Institute of Contemporary Art’s 1948 exhibition, “Forty Years of Modern Art”; commentary says that the ICA had little state support for its activities. “There was no room in English society for the modern artist.” Paintings: art galleries were the only places such work could be seen; most artists survived by teaching. Newsreel coverage of 1950 exhibition of miner-artists’ work in London’s West End. ACE081.5 10:27:52 10:36:28 Newsreel coverage of the first “London County Council Open Air Exhibition of Sculpture”, held at Battersea Park in1951, and attended by the Duke of Wellington, Aneurin Bevan, Jennie Lee, and others.

Commentary talks about the Russians closing off West Berlin. Newsreel announcing the advent of the National Health Service. Aneurin Bevan speaking about new housing. Blocks of flats. Commentary says that “The forties have left us with a series of uninspired tenements on dreary estates. People’s needs, both aesthetic and practical, were not provided for.” Children talking about what they want in their playgrounds. The Somerford Estate, Hackney, which won a Festival of Britain award for its low-rise housing. Festival of Britain emblems on a variety of objects. William Townsend’s 1948 South Bank. Newsreel views of the site and Festival preparations. Clement Attlee laying foundation stone of Royal Festival Hall; commentary says that “In Britain, art is so often defined as prestigious entertainment for the cultivated. In 1948, the grant to the Arts Council was £428,000. Covent Garden Opera House got £98,000, which was about a quarter of the whole cake. Opera, then, is the grandest of the arts. The equivalent art for the people – variety shows, sometimes even useful for government propaganda.” “Sheffield on its Mettle Exhibition”: newsreel shows “a grand pageant of Production, staged in the City Hall…” New cars leaving factory. Commentary notes that Robin Darwin created six new schools of industrial design when he became Rector of the Royal College of Art. British Railway’s “Tavern Train” which prompted Questions in Parliament about a “deplorable” example being set by a publicly owned industry. Stafford Cripps announcing the devaluation of the pound sterling. Members of the Cabinet, including Herbert Morrison and Harold Wilson, entering No.10 Downing Street at the time the West learned of Russia’s atom bomb.

Reg Butler, in his studio; his VO says that the public’s reaction to contemporary sculpture is also how the public relates to him: Girl and Boy (1950-1951), Family Group (1948), etc; he now recognises some of the criticisms levelled at his work at this period. The public saw such work as “…reflections of a mutilated reality”. Francis Bacon’s Figure in a Landscape (1945). Commentary says that artists were concerned with formal problems which led “to pure abstraction”. Two abstracts. Victor Pasmore’s neo-Impressionist Suburban Gardens (1947), and his abstract Square Motif, Blue and Gold: The Eclipse (1950), Abstract in White, Grey and Ochre (1949), Spiral Motif in Green, Violet, Blue and Gold: The Coast of the Inland Sea (1950); commentary quotes critic, Douglas Cooper, who suggested that some painters turned to abstraction to conceal their “obvious ineptness as figurative artists”; Pasmore’s riposte. Newsreel item, Royal Academy Take Back Old Rebel [January 1950]: shows Stanley Spencer, a Self Portrait, and the artist getting up in the morning and going out with his easel on pram. The Port Glasgow Resurrection (1947-1950); commentary says that Spencer was acclaimed “artist of the year” by the popular press, who nonetheless criticised the style of his work.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE082.2 10:00:08 10:08:11 Some of Britain’s ten best-selling prints of paintings including Don Breckon’s Sunday Working (1975). Richard Cork’s narration points out that most of the artists are not represented in British museums, proving that “what the expert calls ‘art’ is one thing, and what people like enough to hang on their living rooms walls quite another”. The exceptions are L S Lowry (An Accident, 1926) and John Constable (Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows, 1831); Cork suggests that these are popular because “they escape from the present” and the perplexities of contemporary art. Cork outside the Tate Gallery, talks about “the often unpopular objects” sometimes displayed there. He wonders if the “elite” can really continue to dismiss popular works while populists talk of “modern art ‘rubbish’”, saying that “this gap between minority art and mass culture” is not “a natural, unchangeable law” and only serves to alienate the opposing sides. Tate interior: works displayed include Henri Matisse’s The Snail / L’Escargot (1953), Roy Lichtenstin’s Wham (1963), etc.; Cork reports that visitors are rarely “working class” which means that the avant garde runs the risk of producing “ingrown art” for gallery goers, rather than challenging society. Against this, “high street print shops are filled with bland, cliché-ridden images which cause as little offence as possible”: inside a branch of the Athena chain. Andrea Marks, PR Consultant for Athena, believes there is a difference between “the art establishment and normal people”: people buy Athena prints because they like the images, not for the name of the artist. Customers looking at pictures. Marks talks about price as another factor; she suggests that people “don’t want to be intimidated by their possessions”, and says they “sell pictures rather than art”. Winston and Melanie discuss the Gauguin print they’ve bought (of Nafea Faaipoipo, 1892), and wonder where to hang it in their flat; she was drawn to it by the two black faces but hadn’t considered how the colours would suit their decor.

            "desc" : "Some of Britain’s ten best-selling prints of paintings including Don Breckon’s Sunday Working (1975). Richard Cork’s narration points out that most of the artists are not represented in British museums, proving that “what the expert calls ‘art’ is one thing, and what people like enough to hang on their living rooms walls quite another”. The exceptions are L S Lowry (An Accident, 1926) and John Constable (Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows, 1831); Cork suggests that these are popular because “they escape from the present” and the perplexities of contemporary art. Cork outside the Tate Gallery, talks about “the often unpopular objects” sometimes displayed there. He wonders if the “elite” can really continue to dismiss popular works while populists talk of “modern art ‘rubbish’”, saying that “this gap between minority art and mass culture” is not “a natural, unchangeable law” and only serves to alienate the opposing sides. Tate interior: works displayed include Henri Matisse’s The Snail / L’Escargot (1953), Roy Lichtenstin’s Wham (1963), etc.; Cork reports that visitors are rarely “working class” which means that the avant garde runs the risk of producing “ingrown art” for gallery goers, rather than challenging society. Against this, “high street print shops are filled with bland, cliché-ridden images which cause as little offence as possible”: inside a branch of the Athena chain. Andrea Marks, PR Consultant for Athena, believes there is a difference between “the art establishment and normal people”: people buy Athena prints because they like the images, not for the name of the artist. Customers looking at pictures. Marks talks about price as another factor; she suggests that people “don’t want to be intimidated by their possessions”, and says they “sell pictures rather than art”. Winston and Melanie discuss the Gauguin print they’ve bought (of Nafea Faaipoipo, 1892), and wonder where to hang it in their flat; she was drawn to it by the two black faces but hadn’t considered how the colours would suit their decor. Tanya and Adrian chose a Constable (Flatford Mill, 1816-1817); she thinks it’s “restful”.

Art class. Pupils say which designs they like best and explain why. Children painting. Commentary: “In 1836, the first school of design was established in London, with responsibility for art education throughout the country…”, the students were expected to find employment in something other than the arts, and the school’s first director believed that artisans should not to be exposed to “high art” nor allowed to draw from life lest they attempted “to better themselves by becoming fine artists”.

Kirkby and Rooley perform I Saw My Lady Weep. Rooley with Cohen who is making a new lute based on a Spanish style and displaying features of the ’ud. Musicians playing ’ud. Rooley’s VO suggests that combining “the freedom and energy” of Arabic music with a European “level of scholarship and … application to detail and craftsmanship” would benefit both traditions.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE091.2 10:00:00 10:10:51 Exterior Beaubourg, street entertainers, passers-by, details of the building, etc. \u000bDenis Postle explains the structure of the programme, a series of shorter pieces, each presenting the arts centre from a different point of view, which they believe amounts to an “official” view of the Beaubourg’s aims and priorities. \u000bONE\u000bThe outside of the Beaubourg; architects’ drawing. Commentary gives statistics for visitors, and asks why they come. Jikke Mura, one of the National Centre for Art and Culture’s official guides, gives brief information on the building. Visitors. Commentary says that Georges Pompidou wanted it to raise “the whole cultural level of the nation”. Mura going towards the Centre for Industrial Creation, pointing out such features as the wall illustrating 20th century industrial advances. Commentary says that this section aims to improve the standard of French industrial design as well as to educate the consumer. Mura continues the tour, and talks about the piazza as it’s seen from one of the escalators. People in the piazza. Mura enters the Library and explains how it works – a collection of books, slides and films and television, etc. – which can be accessed without assistance. Commentary gives more information, pointing out that Library users automatically come into contact with the permanent and changing exhibitions of painting and sculpture. Mura goes to the Museum. Shots of the building’s architectural features; commentary says the building “points to the day when art will become a integral part of everyday life”. Some of the Museum’s collection of paintings, including Francis Bacon’s triptych, Three Figures in a Room (1964). Mura points out the entrance to the Ircam – the Institute for Acoustical and Musical Research. Architectural details of the acoustically tuneable performance space. Mura going towards the “common space”, where exhibitions bring together “the plastic arts and industrial design”. The current exhibition is “Paris-Berlin; Rapports et Contrastes France-Allemagne 1900-1933”. Exterior of the building which commentary says was designed to prevent the public being cut off from the arts by “attitudes of passive admiration”. Mura points out features of the view from the top of the building. Exterior features. Denis Postle talking about the construction of the building.\u000b ACE091.3 10:10:51 10:26:05 TWO\u000bCaption: “The competition 1970-71 attracted 681 entries…. The international jury which included Jean Prouvé, Phillip Johnson and Oscar Niemeyer, awarded prizes to 30 projects in addition to the winning Piano/Rogers/Arup entry.” Caption: “Construction 1972-77 cost (1977) 100,000,000 pounds, site area 100,000 sq metres. Excavation commenced March 1972. Steelwork completed June 1975. Beaubourg opens January 1977.” Commentary introduces Peter Rice, structural engineer, who talks about the problem of helping people relate to such a large building. Early model; photographs. Rice says the structure had to be clear and simple. Demonstration (with model) of how gerberettes (cast steel brackets), placed on steel columns and held in place with steel tension rods, support steel beams. Shots of the actual structure, with Rice explaining how it functions, intercut. Rice suggests that the viewer’s perception of the building is influenced by the attempt to understand it. Further details of structure, showing the framework enclosing an internal space. Rice says the structure forces the viewer to look at the detail, rather than noticing its size. View of the whole building. Overhead photograph of Paris showing the Beaubourg site before construction. Richard Rogers explains talks of the importance of the piazza as a space for people to congregate. Architect’s drawing and model. Rogers’s VO over shots of building and its walkways, with people looking out, and walking inside. He talks about the structure and how it gives the building texture, light, etc. Early development models showing ideas for the building’s “transparency”, though much of the glass originally envisaged had to be replaced for safety reasons. Main entrance hall full of visitors. Rogers, on escalators, talks about the huge increase in visitor numbers (45,000 people per day against an anticipated 2,000) which has caused access issues. Rogers on the minimalist structure, in which materials have been reduced to the least possible quantity in relation to safety and security, but which attracts the visitor to consider its technology. Rogers talking about the way in which interior and exterior interact and blend together. Renzo Piano says that no-one is indifferent to the building. He doesn’t want it to establish a “Beaubourg style”. The Centre was designed as a machine which could be altered to accommodate changes in cultural activities, for example, the use of the Library changing from static to very dynamic. View over Paris towards the Beaubourg. Denis Postle believes it is part of two established traditions, that of prestige projects, and an architectural aesthetic that began in Britain in the 1960s. \u000b ACE091.4 10:26:05 10:41:21 THREE\u000bCaption: “Archigram Group: Warren Chalk, David Greene, Peter Cook, Ron Herron, Dennis Crompton, Michael Webb, Cedric Price.” Peter Cook talks about the British tradition of “being reasonable” which can lead to “lowest common denominator” work. David Greene suggests that architects rarely say no to commissions even if they might not really like the ideas proposed. Ron Herron says that the built environment is “constantly boring”; he criticises a basic tenet of conservation which says that old buildings can’t be improved. Collage of old and new ideas; people on the beach; campsite; funfair; open-air cinema. Captions intercut: “In a changing world why can’t buildings change too?” “Cities are first a number of events and only secondly a collection of buildings.” “The architects first concern is the design of living systems that seek out new purposes and functions for themselves and change as life in them changes.” “What’s needed is a new architecture to stand beside the space capsules, computers and throwaway packs of an atomic world.” Pages from Archigram Magazine. Designs for different kinds of buildings. Professor Reyner Banham talks about the Archigram Group. Images from some Archigram exhibitions which show connections with the Beaubourg: Informaison 1968, Environpole 1969, Plug-In University 1965, Insertions 1968, Oasis 1968. Banham talks about the Centre as being a rare example of such a building actually being constructed as it was conceived. Caption: “Archigram visit Beaubourg.” Members of the group in the piazza, and in the street, looking at and discussing the exterior of the Centre, comparing it to their own theories.

ONE The outside of the Beaubourg; architects’ drawing. Commentary gives statistics for visitors, and asks why they come. Jikke Mura, one of the National Centre for Art and Culture’s official guides, gives brief information on the building. Visitors. Commentary says that Georges Pompidou wanted it to raise “the whole cultural level of the nation”. Mura going towards the Centre for Industrial Creation, pointing out such features as the wall illustrating 20th century industrial advances. Commentary says that this section aims to improve the standard of French industrial design as well as to educate the consumer. Mura continues the tour, and talks about the piazza as it’s seen from one of the escalators. People in the piazza. Mura enters the Library and explains how it works – a collection of books, slides and films and television, etc. – which can be accessed without assistance. Commentary gives more information, pointing out that Library users automatically come into contact with the permanent and changing exhibitions of painting and sculpture. Mura goes to the Museum. Shots of the building’s architectural features; commentary says the building “points to the day when art will become a integral part of everyday life”. Some of the Museum’s collection of paintings, including Francis Bacon’s triptych, Three Figures in a Room (1964). Mura points out the entrance to the Ircam – the Institute for Acoustical and Musical Research. Architectural details of the acoustically tuneable performance space. Mura going towards the “common space”, where exhibitions bring together “the plastic arts and industrial design”. The current exhibition is “Paris-Berlin; Rapports et Contrastes France-Allemagne 1900-1933”. Exterior of the building which commentary says was designed to prevent the public being cut off from the arts by “attitudes of passive admiration”. Mura points out features of the view from the top of the building. Exterior features. Denis Postle talking about the construction of the building.",

The international jury which included Jean Prouvé, Phillip Johnson and Oscar Niemeyer, awarded prizes to 30 projects in addition to the winning Piano/Rogers/Arup entry.” Caption: “Construction 1972-77 cost (1977) 100,000,000 pounds, site area 100,000 sq metres. Excavation commenced March 1972. Steelwork completed June 1975. Beaubourg opens January 1977.” Commentary introduces Peter Rice, structural engineer, who talks about the problem of helping people relate to such a large building. Early model; photographs. Rice says the structure had to be clear and simple. Demonstration (with model) of how gerberettes (cast steel brackets), placed on steel columns and held in place with steel tension rods, support steel beams. Shots of the actual structure, with Rice explaining how it functions, intercut. Rice suggests that the viewer’s perception of the building is influenced by the attempt to understand it. Further details of structure, showing the framework enclosing an internal space. Rice says the structure forces the viewer to look at the detail, rather than noticing its size. View of the whole building. Overhead photograph of Paris showing the Beaubourg site before construction. Richard Rogers explains talks of the importance of the piazza as a space for people to congregate. Architect’s drawing and model. Rogers’s VO over shots of building and its walkways, with people looking out, and walking inside. He talks about the structure and how it gives the building texture, light, etc. Early development models showing ideas for the building’s “transparency”, though much of the glass originally envisaged had to be replaced for safety reasons. Main entrance hall full of visitors. Rogers, on escalators, talks about the huge increase in visitor numbers (45,000 people per day against an anticipated 2,000) which has caused access issues. Rogers on the minimalist structure, in which materials have been reduced to the least possible quantity in relation to safety and security, but which attracts the visitor to consider its technology. Rogers talking about the way in which interior and exterior interact and blend together. Renzo Piano says that no-one is indifferent to the building. He doesn’t want it to establish a “Beaubourg style”. The Centre was designed as a machine which could be altered to accommodate changes in cultural activities, for example, the use of the Library changing from static to very dynamic. View over Paris towards the Beaubourg. Denis Postle believes it is part of two established traditions, that of prestige projects, and an architectural aesthetic that began in Britain in the 1960s.",

David Greene suggests that architects rarely say no to commissions even if they might not really like the ideas proposed. Ron Herron says that the built environment is “constantly boring”; he criticises a basic tenet of conservation which says that old buildings can’t be improved. Collage of old and new ideas; people on the beach; campsite; funfair; open-air cinema. Captions intercut: “In a changing world why can’t buildings change too?” “Cities are first a number of events and only secondly a collection of buildings.” “The architects first concern is the design of living systems that seek out new purposes and functions for themselves and change as life in them changes.” “What’s needed is a new architecture to stand beside the space capsules, computers and throwaway packs of an atomic world.” Pages from Archigram Magazine. Designs for different kinds of buildings. Professor Reyner Banham talks about the Archigram Group. Images from some Archigram exhibitions which show connections with the Beaubourg: Informaison 1968, Environpole 1969, Plug-In University 1965, Insertions 1968, Oasis 1968. Banham talks about the Centre as being a rare example of such a building actually being constructed as it was conceived. Caption: “Archigram visit Beaubourg.” Members of the group in the piazza, and in the street, looking at and discussing the exterior of the Centre, comparing it to their own theories.

Perhaps Cezanne? Looking at the Japanese for whom verisimilitude had never been essential. One of Hokusai’s Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku Sanju Rokkei, c.1826-1833), Under the Fukugawa Mannen Bridge. Japanese prints were very influential; one which Van Gogh copied. Trying to find the essential component which gives the illusion.\u000bMB: Van Gogh was looking for a different kind of “real”, real to the emotions.\u000bDH: real to the experience. Photographic reality is of a second; painting includes layers of time.\u000bMB: The manifestos of the early 20th century when artists began to work in a self-consciously “different” way.\u000bDH: The most radical thing was the invention of Cubism – which was about depicting reality in a better way. Picasso’s Nature morte à la chaise canné / Still Life With Chair Caning (1912) towards verisimilitude which is against “essences” and isn’t natural as we “edit” what we see; nobody sees everything. More Cubist paintings.\u000bMB: Surely this creates a puzzle for anyone else to look at? \u000bDH: Not necessarily. Naturalist picture look skilful, but they are essentially camera images. Canaletto used a camera obscura and his students drew out the detail. The real skill came in filling in the outlines and capturing the Venetian light; painting. \u000b\u000b ACE101.3 10:09:48 10:18:26 MB: Back to Cubism. It seems such a breakaway from the work of artists striving to paint things “as they were seen to be”. \u000bDH: Cubism is about going back to reality. Painting. Cubists were concerned with the many different aspects of a subject, more realistic than a fixed point of view. Portrait by Picasso. Distorting faces raises questions about “why?” because this would normally be the result of some deformation. Picasso recreated the face. This picture has an expression of anxiety and the hands are fidgeting. \u000bMB summarises and asks why Cubists did not take people along with them\u000bDH: They did. Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (1907). Progress was trial and error, not theory, and influences came from outside Europe. A mask by Picasso, influenced by African art. The movement had great influence itself. 1930s posters are influenced by Cubism, as were furniture and other everyday design. McKnight Kauffer poster, Magicians Prefer Shell (1934). Juan Gris’s Chessboard, Glass and Dish (1917). But “all the theoreticians of Cubism were lousy painters”.\u000b ACE101.4 10:18:26 10:29:37 MB: But when looking at a pile of bricks or an all-red canvas, or something resembling junk all stuck together, what is presented to people as “modern art”: is it all a con trick. \u000bDH: Of course not. Painting by Mark Rothko. But it can’t supply us with all our needs, though the theoreticians assumed it could and were supporting movements which went a certain way as they thought this is what history suggested. Go back to the “Bricks” (Carl André’s Equivalent VIII, 1966): they don’t have much meaning outside the context of a gallery, something which is not true of any other kind of art, most of which works anywhere. And it’s not particularly interesting.\u000bMB: But some people have the view that even artists like Picasso are distorting and simplifying in a way that anyone could do. How can people have a chance to recognise the skill involved?\u000bDH shows Matisse’s La Negresse (1952) suggesting that the representation of the hands suggests a fluttering movement. \u000bMB: It may be a brilliant perception but isn’t the execution too simple?\u000bDH: Simple is beautiful if it’s right.\u000bMB pursues the point that people don’t understand the skill required to do what Matisse did and think they could do as well themselves, though they recognise that they could never produce the results that Michelangelo achieved in the Sistine Chapel. \u000bDH: But there hasn’t been anyone else doing what Matisse did. And if it’s because they don’t want to, there’s no answer. Once you go outside the idea that pictures have a magic that can make things vivid for you, there’s no need to defend too much.\u000b\u000b ACE101.5 10:29:37 10:35:00 DH: Faces are the hardest things to do and hands are the next hardest. Art school exam models could not be posed with hands hidden. Picasso’s etching Suite Vollard 83: Minotaur with Cup in Hand and Young Woman (1933): focuses on the hands. Picasso drawings of reclining couple: the incredible skill of being able to depict the difference in male and female skin in a line drawing. \u000bMB: But that’s not what worries people when they talk about modern art; even the “fidgetty fingers” are quite realistic compared with some things presented over the last forty or fifty years. \u000bDH: Picasso portrait – DH describes the figure as “a nun”. A painting executed when Picasso was 90 (c.1970). One from 1965. Picasso didn’t bother with the background because that’s not what the watcher is interested in: the picture concentrates on the woman. \u000b ACE101.6 10:35:00 10:45:25 MB: Do you need to have had some education to feel what you’ve described?\u000bDH: No, though you might have to get rid of a few prejudices such as the assumption that a photograph tells the truth. The government wouldn’t allow a self-portrait in a passport as it might not be a likeness. But people can “put on a mask” when they’re photographed, and the result won’t be particularly like them\u000bMB: You could argue that, once photography was discovered, “the game was up for painting”. \u000bDH: True of Canaletto – the postcards of Venice have replaced such paintings. And the subject matter of photographs doesn’t usually move one in the same way. The Victoria and Albert Museum’s exhibition “From Today, Painting is Dead” can really only refer to British 19th century “topographical painters” who used camera obscura to paint landscapes. The Picasso painting couldn’t be done in photography. \u000bMB summarising: Exponents of the Cubist movement at the beginning of the 20th century explored it for ten to fifteen years, moved on, and left the wreckage of theory in their wake?\u000bDH: People with a generous spirit don’t find problems with Picasso and Matisse now. And it’s not for us to decide how important their work was anyway. \u000bMB: Can you explain what you mean by being moved by a painting? What comes across to you?\u000bDH: When you’ve moved, you even forget about skill. Very hard to describe. Thoughts about how Matisse saw, remembered, made the image, what he liked. Thinking of the artist doing it is moving. Van Gogh’s popularity is very real, you don’t have to be an expert. He’d find some joy in all the little things around. It’s very moving to do it and to give it to everybody else. It’s unbelievably generous. An artist must have a generous spirit or he can’t do anything with his experience. \u000bCredits.\u000b",

Commentary: “And why, after years in obscurity, have two sets of photographs recently had their first public showing?” Early 20th century footage of children in street jostling each other to look at the camera filming them. Commentary: “In the early of this century, there existed in northern England a race of people unknown to those in the south. It’s difficult to realise that, prior to the documentary movement of the 1930s, there were very few images of these people.” Photograph of anthropologist, Tom Harrisson, with Borneo villager. Commentary says that they knew more about Bolton (the city that supplied their cloth) than Harrisson did and he decided to go to live in the town. Derelict house in Davenport Street; surrounding area. Some of the photographs, part of “a unique social experiment” in which were recorded, “in painstaking detail, the rituals and behaviour of these exotic and unknown peoples in our own country”, which grew into the Mass-Observation (MO) project. Humphrey Spender, the MO photographer, at his studio in Chelmsford. Commentary explains that Spender and his brother, Stephen, were among the “young, upper middle class intellectuals who saw the need to redress the balance between the leaders of society and the led.” Spender talks about his politics and activism. ACE112.3 10:04:31 10:09:54 Early and current footage of Bolton, where Spender came to live in 1937. Photographs from the pre-war period with film of the same locations today.

Photographs of men in public houses; Spender’s VO says he found himself “forced into … frightening social confrontations”. Some of Spender’s photographs, “empty of people”, which, commentary suggests, reflect “that tension between fear and attraction”. Pub interior. Commentary describes the aims of MO, with its Observers being part of the community, rather than looking at it from outside, “‘to make visible the invisible patterns of everyday life’”; this enabled them to better criticise government and other policies based on indifference to the realities of working class life. Spender in pub. Some of Spender’s photographs. Photograph of Harrisson and Observers at breakfast in Davenport Street; Spender describes how they were briefed, even to look at “small specific actions” such as how people held their cups.

Spender on Harrisson’s idea that painters could add a subjective dimension to the project. Photograph of William Coldstream painting a view of Bolton from the Gallery roof. Spender describes Harrisson’s view of photography as a useful tool in recording human behaviour, and suspects he not would have agreed with W H Auden’s claim that the camera is “a bloody liar”. Contact sheets; commentary says that the idea that “truth” existed and could be captured photographically was fundamental “to the working of the documentary concept”. Spender’s VO says that this “truth” was thought to exist if the subject did not know he or she was being photographed (Funeral of John Shaw, Davenport Street, 1937). Images of women and laundry, one of which (Back Alley, 1937) Spender remembers simply as making “a marvellous photograph”. Spender talks about MO’s lack of resources which meant that they could not afford to reproduce photographs in any of their books. The cover of the first Picture Post, which recruited Spender in 1938. Photographs from the magazine, some the result of Spender’s commission to tour major British towns.

Spender describes how he followed this with a report, made at the request of the Mayor, “on new housing estates and … mayoral banquets…” which only served to underline the poverty shown in the earlier one.

He talks about how this sequence reflected his initial reaction to London. Smith crossing a railway footbridge outside North Shields. Commentary says that, on his first journey home from London, he “found his relationship to the community he had left had unexpectedly changed”. Smith VO explains his reactions; photographs he took at the time intercut with current conditions; he points out that his work documented the decline of the area. He talks about the two elderly women he photographed sitting on a street corner, who, he discovered, knew his grandfather. South Bank (1975) shows a shirtless man on a “mid-summer afternoon, waiting for the newspapers to arrive”. \u000b\u000b ACE112.6 10:25:07 10:31:48 Public house.

Smith looking at negatives; his VO talks about mounting an exhibition of photographs, which turned out to be those taken by Humphrey Spender. Boys’ Brigade. Visitors to the exhibition; commentary points out that the images now represented places and events long vanished, and says that critics began to re-evaluate the work and assess it in terms of its market value. Spender says a would-be purchaser was more interested in the photographs as vintage prints than in getting best quality reproductions. Smith talks about the importance to him of the success of the exhibition. In Newcastle. Commentary says that Smith stopped working as a photographer and became more interested in “reclaiming images which had been lost, discarded or neglected” and began researching and organising exhibitions at the Side Gallery.

Smith’s VO talking about this “systematic and … very authoritative document” of a changing working class community produced by someone from the community itself. More photographs of people in the streets. Commentary wonders how many people from the Scotswood area would actually come to see the photographs in an exhibition. Smith shows Forsyth round gallery. Commentary asks if it is likely that Forsyth’s work will become collectible like that of Spender. Smith’s VO talking about people’s perception of galleries as being for “works of art”, so this is the context in which Forsyth’s photographs will have to appear; because of press interest, he also wonders if they will become saleable as “vintage prints”. More of the photographs. Forsyth with a new camera. Spender’s workroom; commentary says he has given up photography and now paints and teaches art. Spender says “there is always something convincing about a photograph” and that he would rather be a good painter than a good photographer. Shipyard scenes. Smith with photographs of building of the Mauretania. He talks about parallels between the 1930s and the present day; he suggests that few photographs are taken that do not appear in the conservative context of newspapers, and that galleries can provide an alternative.

It was originally modelled in both clay and plaster, some of the shapes being stones from the beach cast in plaster. ACE115.3 10:05:11 10:10:49 Slow Movement (1965). Caro describes it as being “real”, though it’s “not meant to be anything”. Lynton says that even though it’s not representational, nonetheless it can move him as a figure could. Caro talks about elaborating and then simplifying ad reducing it. He decided on the colour (“Deep Body Blue”) to paint the steel shape “very late”. He says that he often finds it difficult to decide on a colour, just as he finds it difficult to title works, though he thinks that titles are not helpful. ACE115.4 10:10:49 10:15:19 Shore (1968). Lynton describes it as “man-made” and “architectural”. Caro thinks it has an unusual feature, a “leg” rather than the piece “floating” as many of his other works do, which gives it “an engineering look” though he doesn’t want it to have “that muscle-flexing thing”. He believes that artists shouldn’t do things again; if they know how to do something, they should move on, “discover”, which is what makes art productive. He suggests that otherwise “it becomes performance” “which is what Picasso did at the end of his life”. ACE115.5 10:15:19 10:19:11 CCLXIX (1975). Lynton describes the steel as seeming “soft”. Caro talks about discovering “soft, loose ends”; steel pieces he was sent from Consett were not all what he had thought he would be getting and he’s pleased he was able to use them.

Caption: “On two consecutive Tuesdays in April 1972, Edward Burra was interviewed during the making of the Arts Council sponsored film on the artist and his work. The intention was to obtain statements that could be taken out of context for inclusion in the film, but Edward Burra had other ideas about the way the interview should be conducted. The resulting dialogue presents a unique portrait of an artist who had never previously been filmed. “The film consists of all the interview material assembled in chronological order, un-edited and with only a few fragments of technically faulty footage cut out.” 17th April, 1972: Edward Burra talks about science fiction and fantasy fiction. Says he’d bored. Would rather be painting. Loses connection with older paintings. Probably likes some more than others but doesn’t know which. Doesn’t remember when he painted things. Currently likes painting landscapes – but might not. Doesn’t have anything to say about his landscapes with trucks. Doesn’t want to talk about certain things as he doesn’t want to offend people. Talks about visiting galleries: sometimes looks at his own paintings but sometimes doesn’t as he already knows them. Frames make pictures look different. Used to talk about films, rarely about paintings. Talks with friends about books, the theatre, how terrible actors are, very little about art. He claims to know very few artists. Prefers the country to the town. Visits London occasionally to see friends. Slate for end of take. ACE117.3 10:13:12 10:35:12 Burra laughs at the idea that people will improve themselves by looking at his pictures. Pressed by interviewer, he repeats that he doesn’t really like talking about art. Adds that papers sometimes write nonsense about him. But it doesn’t matter what people say. Nothing matters. Hardly ever hangs up his paintings. Used to leave them lying about and put them in cupboards. Now people buy them. Used to draw on both sides of the paper; one was framed so that it could be turned over. Two for one, a bargain. Says he’s sometimes misquoted but can’t think of examples. Why get angry with people? Doesn’t like formality such as having to hire a morning coat to go to Paris to receive a medal; didn’t go. Some artists like being asked about their work, but Burra thinks it’s bad to pry. Countryside has changed, particularly along main roads – too many gnomes and carriage lamps. Better in the North. Likes Yorkshire as it’s “nice and bare”. Likes views of big arterial roads. Likes gangster pictures and films with Pola Negri and Gloria Swanson which he has seen again at the National Film Theatre. Does his own shopping. Likes Mexico and the United States. While he was there he’d drink, read books, visits people. Paints straight onto paper, though used to do drawings. Stayed with friends in Florence. Very crowded there. Did a painting of the Zona Industriale. Writes letters; likes getting some letters but not others. Has a old suitcase instead of a filing system. Doesn’t have a view on the rightness or wrongness of making films about people. It’s all right if people go to see them. Journalists usually get everything a teeny bit wrong.

Hodgkin: “… if you particularise too much, particularly about private emotions …they would remain in the painting private emotions… the more I think about this, my paintings are really totally metaphorical… a metaphor for emotion.” View from the tomb verandah over the tank.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE125.2 10:00:00 10:02:55 “For John Heartfield 1891-1968.” Film of Heartfield with his photomontage Adolf the Superman: Eats Gold and Spouts Junk / Adolf der Übermensch – Schluckt Gold und redet Blech (1932). Commentary says this programme will look at photomontage for political use, concentrating on the work of Peter Kennard, whose images cover a wide range of issues connecting art and politics. Photograph of fist holding broken missile. Peter Kennard says he prefers to use photographs which “refer more back to reality” than paint which “refers back to art”, and that he started in 1968, using images coming out of the Vietnam war to show “what was behind those events”. He says that the established art world considers overtly political work to be propaganda and not art. Photomontage can show the conflicts that go on beneath images. Examples.\u000b\u000b ACE125.3 10:02:55 10:15:08 SECTION 1 Kennard’s home. Magazines and newspapers. Colour supplements. VO reading “The streams of images we encounter every day move on the threshold of consciousness. News from afar. Pictures of ourselves. News of distant people and places…” Caption: “1 Defining.” Commentary says “Photomontage works by combining separate images to produce new meanings… When two images are combined, their meanings interact to produce a third meaning.” 1933 montage, A Pan German, by John Heartfield, combines an image of Julius Streicher with that of a murder victim. Peter Kennard has combined John Constable’s The Hay Wain with Cruise missiles in Say No to Cruise Missiles (1980) to comment on plans to put missiles on mobile transporters. Ironic comment by Margaret Bourke White (1937) in which she photographed a queue of black flood victims in Louisville in front of a billboard image of a white family in car which proclaimed “World’s Highest Standard of Living… There’s no way like the American Way”. Photograph from London street (1980) juxtaposing advertisement for stockings with Christian Aid poster. Eton pupils and local boys, from Picture Post, 1941, illustrating article “The Two Nations”. Commentary asks questions about this composition. Caption: “Montages which do not work.” Kennard says some of his own montages didn’t work because the contradictions in the images weren’t strong enough. Examples. Kennard comments on a page of photographs from the Sunday Times. Caption: “Images are nothing… It’s the relationships between the images that matter.” Examples, including USSR: Russische Ausstellung poster by Lazar (El) Lissitzky (1929). Commentary lists some reasons why photomontage has been used: Surrealist explorations of the unconscious, Russian constructivism, etc. This programme is concerned solely with photomontage “which deliberately constructs the juxtaposition of imagery with the aim of understanding the world politically”, gives an example of the work of John Heartfield (1932), Spitzenproduktie des Kapitalismus / The Finest Productions of Capitalism, a bride next to unemployed man wearing placard saying “Nehme jede Arbeit an!”. Commentary proceeds to deconstruct the meaning of this image, asks what images could be used to produce similar contrasts today, and whether or not photomontage is actually effective at expressing complex statements. Film of reflection of Asprey’s jewellers against rest of street scene, adding, in caption, the cost of the piece of jewellery in the window. Colour supplement images. Commentary says that dominant media keep images of wealth and power in different social groups “rigidly separate” from each other. There’s no relation between “different realities”. Advertisement for Air India, with caption read as VO, compared with image of airport cleaner with ironic caption. Commentary says “Photomontage counteracts the convenient separation of different aspects of the world.” Kennard explains one of his pictures, a comment on the Junta in Chile, which compares the military to a slaughter-house. Commentary says that the “third meaning” is “the brutality of oppression”, and goes on to talk about Eisenstein and his theories of montage. Stills from Strike / Stachka (1925). Caption: “‘A work of art, understood dynamically, is just this process of arranging images in the feelings and mind of the spectator’. Eisenstein.” Eisenstein’s theories influenced many iflm-makers, including Fernando Solanos’s La Hora de los Hornos / The Hour of the Furnaces (1968) in which the slaughter-house is juxtaposed with images from advertisements.\u000b ACE125.4 10:15:08 10:24:17 SECTION 2 Kennard’s home. Television. VO reading “A ceaseless succession of strange shapes and sounds. The darkness has an edge that grates the nerves of the sleeper…” Caption: “2 Constructing.” Part of work by Kennard commenting on the Cold War. Caption: “Assembling components.” Kennard explains how he made different versions of this photomontage which he wanted to point up “the futility of the [British] government’s plans for civil defence”. Caption: “Using frames.” Kennard explains how he added to an existing photograph of Henry Kissinger for a New Stateman cover on “The Kissinger Mind”, and shows a similar picture from 1924 by Alexander Rodchenko, The Critic Ossip Brik. Kennard’s map of Britain with magnifying glass view of skeleton superimposed. He quotes E. P. Thompson writing on the issue of a set of stamps commemorating the anniversary of the Metropolitan Police, shortly after the death of Blair Peach. Kennard’s photomontage. Commentary says that here, “photomontage is used to provide a critique of reality. In its act of unmasking, montage becomes political.” Caption: “‘The situation is complicated by the fact that a simple reproduction of reality rarely reveals anything about reality. A photograph of the Krupp works or G.E.C. factory tells us almost nothing about these institutions. The human relations and functions inside the factory are not explicit in a photograph… so something must be built up, something constructed, something artificially posed.’ Brecht.” Caption: “Making the invisible visible.” Kennard shows a photograph of the Dow Chemicals factory, pointing out that nothing in the photograph indicates that this factory made napalm used by American forces in the Vietnam war. He shows how he altered a photograph of a nuclear power station – adding missiles – to make the connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Other images. Caption: “Changing images to change ideas.” Kennard points out that both pro- and anti-nuclear groups use similar images, and shows how those images can also become commercialised. In his own work, he may still use similar shots but will add to them to try to show the destructive potential of nuclear power. Example. \u000b\u000b ACE125.5 10:24:17 10:35:08 SECTION 3 Driving past long rows of advertising hoardings, and rows of posters beside an Underground escalator. VO reading “The imaginary discourse of commerce occupies more and more of our city’s walls. It unwinds street by street, hardly interrupted by the ends of the avenues…” Caption: “3 Using/effecting.” Kennard. John Heartfield’s top-hatted hyena War and Corpses - the Last Hope of the Rich (1932). Commentary says that Kennard’s work can be traced back to that of John Heartfield in the 1930s, and links to that of other people working today, such as Klaus Staeck in West Germany. Example of Staeck’s work, and similar images by Kennard. Commentary says Staeck refuses to sign his work and reproduces it in large quantity so that the posters “cannot become valued as individual works of art”. Mass production offers economy of scale so that a complete exhibition can be cheaper than a single art print: examples include Mona Lisa in a wheelchair with English caption, Nobody’s perfect, superimposed. Staeck’s work is widely available and much used. Caption “‘Use art to make reality by producing conflict.’ Staeck.” Work of Peter Dunn and Lorraine Leeson. The National Health Service Thirty Years On… Health Before Profits. Commentary talks about their “working directly with particular communities on specific issues”, trying “to be both popular and explanatory”. Other health-service-related image. Commentary says their work is distributed through Trades Councils and Health Service Trades Union branches to interested groups. People making collages. Kennard’s VO on working with a range of groups, saying how even the act of cutting out images will make people see them differently and thus begin to think differently about their relationship to society. Caption: “Images in Circulation.” Kennard talking about the need to circulate new images as widely as possible. He shows examples of books covers (John Downing’s The Media Machine, Lesley Doyal’s The Political Economy of Health, Martin Ryle’s The Politics of Nuclear Disarmament) which require simple, strong images; postcards; cheaply produced pamphlets like Richard Sissons’s NO Nuclear Weapons; magazine covers for New Society, Camerawork, Voluntary Action, Viewpoint, New Scientist, etc, and articles in The Guardian, Peace News, etc. Posters: Kennard’s No to Nuclear Weapons, Solidarnosc, the Polish Solidarity Campaign, and others. Caption: “Uses of an image.” Kennard talking about making a collage for a 1980 Labour party anti-nuclear march, and shows how he made the broken missile in fist image, and the various ways it was used. Caption: “Anti-nuclear montages.” Kennard on the lack of debate on nuclear war. Mushroom cloud map of UK; skeleton reading Protect and Survive booklet; CND symbol cutting missile, and several others pinned up on a fence. Anti-nuclear demonstration. Kennard talking about conventional media juxtapositions, and says that “montage is an attempt to turn these disparate elements into a visual language of opposition”. Credits.

Commentary says “Photomontage counteracts the convenient separation of different aspects of the world.” Kennard explains one of his pictures, a comment on the Junta in Chile, which compares the military to a slaughter-house. Commentary says that the “third meaning” is “the brutality of oppression”, and goes on to talk about Eisenstein and his theories of montage. Stills from Strike / Stachka (1925). Caption: “‘A work of art, understood dynamically, is just this process of arranging images in the feelings and mind of the spectator’. Eisenstein.” Eisenstein’s theories influenced many iflm-makers, including Fernando Solanos’s La Hora de los Hornos / The Hour of the Furnaces (1968) in which the slaughter-house is juxtaposed with images from advertisements.",

The darkness has an edge that grates the nerves of the sleeper…” Caption: “2 Constructing.” Part of work by Kennard commenting on the Cold War. Caption: “Assembling components.” Kennard explains how he made different versions of this photomontage which he wanted to point up “the futility of the [British] government’s plans for civil defence”. Caption: “Using frames.” Kennard explains how he added to an existing photograph of Henry Kissinger for a New Stateman cover on “The Kissinger Mind”, and shows a similar picture from 1924 by Alexander Rodchenko, The Critic Ossip Brik. Kennard’s map of Britain with magnifying glass view of skeleton superimposed. He quotes E. P. Thompson writing on the issue of a set of stamps commemorating the anniversary of the Metropolitan Police, shortly after the death of Blair Peach. Kennard’s photomontage. Commentary says that here, “photomontage is used to provide a critique of reality. In its act of unmasking, montage becomes political.” Caption: “‘The situation is complicated by the fact that a simple reproduction of reality rarely reveals anything about reality. A photograph of the Krupp works or G.E.C. factory tells us almost nothing about these institutions. The human relations and functions inside the factory are not explicit in a photograph… so something must be built up, something constructed, something artificially posed.’ Brecht.” Caption: “Making the invisible visible.” Kennard shows a photograph of the Dow Chemicals factory, pointing out that nothing in the photograph indicates that this factory made napalm used by American forces in the Vietnam war. He shows how he altered a photograph of a nuclear power station – adding missiles – to make the connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Other images. Caption: “Changing images to change ideas.” Kennard points out that both pro- and anti-nuclear groups use similar images, and shows how those images can also become commercialised. In his own work, he may still use similar shots but will add to them to try to show the destructive potential of nuclear power. Example.",

VO reading “The imaginary discourse of commerce occupies more and more of our city’s walls. It unwinds street by street, hardly interrupted by the ends of the avenues…” Caption: “3 Using/effecting.” Kennard. John Heartfield’s top-hatted hyena War and Corpses - the Last Hope of the Rich (1932). Commentary says that Kennard’s work can be traced back to that of John Heartfield in the 1930s, and links to that of other people working today, such as Klaus Staeck in West Germany. Example of Staeck’s work, and similar images by Kennard. Commentary says Staeck refuses to sign his work and reproduces it in large quantity so that the posters “cannot become valued as individual works of art”. Mass production offers economy of scale so that a complete exhibition can be cheaper than a single art print: examples include Mona Lisa in a wheelchair with English caption, Nobody’s perfect, superimposed. Staeck’s work is widely available and much used. Caption “‘Use art to make reality by producing conflict.’ Staeck.” Work of Peter Dunn and Lorraine Leeson. The National Health Service Thirty Years On… Health Before Profits. Commentary talks about their “working directly with particular communities on specific issues”, trying “to be both popular and explanatory”. Other health-service-related image. Commentary says their work is distributed through Trades Councils and Health Service Trades Union branches to interested groups. People making collages. Kennard’s VO on working with a range of groups, saying how even the act of cutting out images will make people see them differently and thus begin to think differently about their relationship to society. Caption: “Images in Circulation.” Kennard talking about the need to circulate new images as widely as possible. He shows examples of books covers (John Downing’s The Media Machine, Lesley Doyal’s The Political Economy of Health, Martin Ryle’s The Politics of Nuclear Disarmament) which require simple, strong images; postcards; cheaply produced pamphlets like Richard Sissons’s NO Nuclear Weapons; magazine covers for New Society, Camerawork, Voluntary Action, Viewpoint, New Scientist, etc, and articles in The Guardian, Peace News, etc. Posters: Kennard’s No to Nuclear Weapons, Solidarnosc, the Polish Solidarity Campaign, and others. Caption: “Uses of an image.” Kennard talking about making a collage for a 1980 Labour party anti-nuclear march, and shows how he made the broken missile in fist image, and the various ways it was used. Caption: “Anti-nuclear montages.” Kennard on the lack of debate on nuclear war. Mushroom cloud map of UK; skeleton reading Protect and Survive booklet; CND symbol cutting missile, and several others pinned up on a fence. Anti-nuclear demonstration. Kennard talking about conventional media juxtapositions, and says that “montage is an attempt to turn these disparate elements into a visual language of opposition”. Credits.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE132.2 10:00:00 10:06:00 Extracts from Castle One (aka Lightbulb Film;1966): montage of newsreel and other films. Malcolm Le Grice (part VO) says “I want to see a cinema that is in clear opposition to the dominant film and TV culture”, points out that the roots of such film-making go back to the origins of modern art, and says that he’s “always tried to give the spectator a positive and productive role”. Phillip Drummond talks about the history of the independent, avant garde, cinema, originating in the early Soviet era of the 1920s, coming to prominence in the United States in the 1940s, and now an international phenomenon with its own production, distribution and exhibition outlets. He describes Malcolm Le Grice’s career as a film-maker, teacher and author. Le Grice describes his starting out as a painter, being interested in “transformation and process” and realising that this combination of “movement” and static art form was not unsatisfactory. Talks briefly about his interest in music, and says that he used musical concepts in early films, and made his own soundtracks. Extract from Reign of the Vampire (aka How to Screw the C I A; 1970) in which the soundtrack “largely determined the structure of the film”. The sound was controlled using two tape recorders and a mixer, producing a repeating but slowly changing rhythm of sounds, and the images were similarly based on repeating loops. Le Grice VO talking about the threatening (military) nature of many of the images in his early films. Le Grice says he decided that the films were more an expression of paranoia than genuinely political, and he concluded that there was more political value in their artistic structure than in the images, a concept now generally accepted. He adds that cost was another important factor.\u000b\u000b ACE132.3 10:06:00 10:14:17 LeGrice and Drummond at the London Film-Makers Co-Op. Film-makers at work. Le Grice says he was heavily involved in the workshop. Having a purpose-built laboratory not only made a great difference to cost, but also enabled film-makers to transform the images on the film itself. Raw material for Berlin Horse (1970) in which Le Grice superimposed negative onto positive, employed colour filters, and superimposed coloured elements. Extract. Drummond and Le Grice talk VO about the form of the film taking precedence over its content. Le Grice talks VO about multi-screen projection. Berlin Horse in two-screen version. Le Grice VO talking about having rejected narrative as something which “drew spectators away from their own reality”, and then doing away with the film image as well. Extract from version of film/performance Horror Film (1971). Le Grice VO describing the work and his purpose in making it. Le Grice says that in this and a few subsequent films (described by Drummond as “austere”, he wanted the spectator to deal only with the presentation of the work itself. After this, he made a much more complex film based on Manet’s Le Dejeuner sur l’Herbe (1863), After Manet (1974), and using four cameras to produce multi-screen images. Le Grice points out that each of the four “actors” was also a film-maker and had charge of one of the cameras. Extracts. He talks about the different kinds of film-stock used and how the spectator responds to the difference between negative and positive images. Images from a still photograph piece based on After Manet. ACE132.4 10:14:17 10:25:49 Drummond asks about Academic Still Life (1977) and its art historical references. Le Grice says that in Cézanne’s works, small movements of the spectator’s head change the image of the thing seen. He thinks that Academic Still Life, like much of Cézanne’s work is “a product of the act of perception”. Extract. Le Grice’s VO describing his work as being concerned with reality, and his later films reflect a “very extreme reality”, showing the mundane realities of life. Extracts from Time and Motion Study (1978). Le Grice VO says he’s also concerned with breaking illusion, and editing is the most important element in this. The film uses two cameras and there is a slight overlap between the two, thus eliminating any break in time, and suggesting that there is no significant difference between the act of making a film and the activities shown in it. Le Grice talks about the formal difference between his kind of work and conventional film-making, and believe that he can best make a difference through education. Activities at St Martin’s School of Art; Le Grice’s film theory class. Drummond and Le Grice talk about Finnegan’s Chin (1981), made at St Martin’s with the participation of some of the students. The plans for the film, a “visual score” rather than a script. Le Grice describes the content. Extract. Drummond says it’s paradoxical that they are in a conventional television documentary. Le Grice says that virtually anything in an experimental film will be different to the sort of things seen on television. He believes television will have to show more experimental work. Credits.",

Man talking about advertising being a modern art form, drawing on centuries of European art, and one which, because of its appearance in public places, is accessible to all. Woman in kitchen peeling potatoes. “Television” over, discussing how commercials appeal to their audience. “Women don’t necessarily want to see a mirror image of themselves....” Still from PG Tips advertisement featuring chimpanzee in dressing gown.

Magazine advertisement for IPC Young Women’s Magazines suggesting that they reach a particular group of women. Interior of large supermarket. The woman putting her purchases onto the checkout conveyor; VO quotes the advertising slogans for each item. Hoardings.

Commentary describes the film as looking at “the connection between images and markets…[in] their relation to work”. Chocolate factory. Consumer goods on conveyor. VO quoting advertising slogans and descriptions. Car. Household furniture. Commentary says products are the “reward” for work, a reassurance of personal value. Extract from An Englishman’s Home (1946) advertising film, showing household ornaments “so simple, and yet so important”. Shop windows. Commentary says products offer dreams as well as uses. Images from television advertising, “a vision” which “doesn’t include working life”. Film vault. Commentary says advertising images have changed over time; work, no longer visible, used to shown. Vinolia Soap (1897) in which factory women are seen packing the product. One of the Close-Ups of the Stars (1947), Lever Bros. advertisements for Lux soap, in which the work is that of a film star (Valerie Hobson) rather than that of “every girl”. A 1976 advertisement for soap in which the bar appears totally divorced from work of any kind. ACE136.3 10:09:52 10:17:28 The woman unpacking her shopping. Commentary says advertisements are “directed at the home”. Caption: “When can work be shown in advertising?” Commentary suggests (with supporting images from tea advertisements) that work can be shown when it’s being done by people other than the consumer. Extracts from Song of Ceylon (1934), Empire Marketing Board. Baskets of tea, coffee, and sugar on conveyor. Crossing map from Britain down Africa. VO goes on to list rubber and mineral resources, and “the captive markets, the suppression of the uprising, the essential economic links, the international marketing policy, the multinational corporation, the British Empire”. Commentary says advertising images are bound up with Britain’s economic past. Collages of images from advertising and the imperial past. Commentary talks about the colonies providing “raw materials, cheap labour, and … a market…”, and about how those markets were expanded to the benefit of the capitalist economy. Tea advertisements. Rum advertisement with black waiter serving white bathers. Lux advertisements from 1920s (?) featuring black stereotypes which are no longer acceptable, thanks to changes in social conditions. Throat lozenge advertisement incorporating image of mushroom cloud; picture of a British soldier (“the cleanest fighter in the world”) used for 1910s Sunlight Soap. “The relation of the audience to the dominant ideas of any period” determines what advertising can show.

The Economist (1921), Osram Lightbulbs, which emphasises the Britishness of the product, rather than the labour of its production, and is shown from the point of view of someone not of the (working) class that produces the product. “The relation between economic forces, nationalistic ideas and the image of industrial work, is shown particularly clearly through changes in the image of women working.” Advertisements during World War II and post-war, the latter promoting women’s work in the home and consumer goods for the home market. Advertising directed at particular target audiences. Family centred television advertisements for DIY and for home furnishing. The importance of domestic goods means that housework can be shown in detail (television advertisement for “Flash” cleaner (1960), Proctor & Gamble) as the work is actually consumption of the product. ACE136.5 10:24:11 10:36:15 Caption: “When is work not shown in advertising?” Commentary talks about a separation of images of work and home, with the family being the most important target for marketing. Advertisements for breakfast cereals showing family units. Photograph of man riding horse-drawn harvester “which would not be found in a cereal ad” though it could be used for other products.

The family “has its own past” which relates to work and to “another side of history”. (1926), WaveBill Baxter’s Dilemmarley Oats, in which window cleaner sees a better porridge than the one he gets at home. An image of “worker as consumer” has particular importance in the year of the General Strike, “a period of violent class conflict”.

Worker-less car advertisements. Nature’s Charms (1933), Austin Motor Co., intercut with film of workers leaving car factory, and with images from current advertising which pick up on the same rural and family-centred themes at a time when industrial production is in decline.

Workers leaving factory. An Englishman’s Home (1946), Horlicks. Car worker returning to his council flat. Advertisement captioned “Leisure. It’s what you come home for.” Man brings the woman some chocolates; she serves family dinner.

Work is shown only when it appears distant from its intended audience, or when it is nationally rather than class related. Family watching factory health and safety film aimed at employers, intercut with scenes from The Economist and An Englishman’s Home. Television advertisement for Myer’s Comfortable Beds; other images of “dreams and desires”, all of which point to consumerism.

He is shown old photographs, and identifies one place as belonging to an old potter called Raymond Gaubier who retired in the 1960s. Another man recognises photographs of his father, born 1867, and his sister; he identifies various activities shown in the pictures and points out where they took place. The man talks about throwing a large pot. More photographs of the pottery buildings and men at work. Film of comparable activities today. Man talks about his great-grandfather (died 1867), and all his family; each generation from 1549 having produced a few potters. He shows pits in the surrounding forest where his family dug their clay, and reads part of a legal document granting rights for clay gathering.

Opie says that the theme of these three related pieces is “people hiding behind large objects”; each piece is hiding or showing something. He says they are not intended to be funny but “often a joke or a story is a good way to carry … more formal ideas”. He prefers to turn a piece into a joke to make it more accessible as well as more fun to make. He is interested in both form and content and is happy when several interests can be combined. He doesn’t mind his work being seen as “cartoon like” but tries to get away from the idea of stage props. He wants the work to look light and easy though points out that a good deal of work goes into the steel construction at the back. He doesn’t know if these pieces should be regarded as painting or sculpture – they are in a sculpture show but he can think of them as “very complicated canvases”. He wants them to look “kind of weird” so that the viewer is “not sure whether they are flat or whether they’re 3-D… the painting is cheap illusion”. Details of sculptures. Opie standing in front of one of the works. He talks about how long it takes to make one piece. More sculptures. He says he’s not interested in forcing his work on anyone; he prefers the audience to come by choice. Opie talking about his career since leaving art school a year earlier; he’s already selling well enough to be able to concentrate on his work full time. ACE142.3 10:10:32 10:18:45 Opie says that one sculpture evolved from the idea of signing a work on the front but brought in more and more ideas. Opie beside another work. Opie says he’s always drawn things so perhaps his success is not quite over night. He’s sure he’ll do different work in the future so is pleased that these pieces are being shown now. He says that his pre-art school work is recognisably his, though then he “didn’t know what he was doing”. He believes that art schools often teach people to work in ways that “other people think is art” and that “it took a couple of years to shake that off”. He found his teacher, Craig Martin, very helpful, explaining that he sometimes needed encouragement to go with a particular idea that seemed “very small”. Opie says he thinks he has been influenced by Roy Lichtenstein’ sculptures, the painting style of Frans Hals, Hergé (Georges Rémi) – he says that the idea of this book piece comes from of The Seven Crystal Balls – Bill Woodrow, and others, but feels that he has to “carry on with [his] own position”.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE144.2 10:00:00 10:10:30 Sound only. Drums and voice repeating “Was ist Kunst?” Same sound continues over photograph of soldiers and of Stuart Brisley. Monochrome film of woman sitting almost completely still. Voice-over now shouting “Was ist Kunst?” Woman. Commentary VO says that “All behaviour is performance. Performance behaviour is a condition of art. Performance behaviours are Ghost Dances in a dying culture. Performance behaviour is an artistic and social phenomenon of East and West where differing ideologies mask the common destruction of cultural values, and simultaneously suppress the search for new models.” “Was ist Kunst” continues over at the same time. “Performance is made up of moments where the performer behaves according to an inner reality, unhampered by prior notions of how a thing should be done. It involves risk. Risk is essential.” Shouting voice continues over. Colour slowly fades into the monochrome image. Woman. Commentary identifies the off-screen shouting voice as that of Ra?a Todosijevi?, being directed towards a passive figure on screen, representing, among other things, isolation, alienation. Ritual acting out is as old history itself. Ritual used to have only participants; the crucial difference today, is that there are also observers. A group of men singing “To be a farmer’s boy” in a pub. VO of one of their number describing (VO) how they’ll have a couple of drinks, sing a few traditional songs, and move on to another venue. Men in the street. Song continues over. Watchers of the Hood game lining up in muddy field. Man’s VO gives date as January 6: the ancient game of Haxey Hood. Field, players. Commentary describes the Haxey Hood, saying that the original Hood was likely to have been the head of a sacrificed bull. Game continues; commentary reads excerpts from an earlier description of the game, and offers contemporary analysis. Darkness. ACE144.3 10:10:30 10:22:58 DISASSOCIATION\u000b “Like ritual, performance takes place in real time.” “Image ‘Approaches to Learning’, Brisley/Robertson U.K.1980”. Man gets out of a lift, walks slowly round another man who’s standing outside it. They pace around, stand still, pace, one hits the other who falls, gets up; both pace. Heard over is “voice: ‘The Hand and the Nail’ [Zbigniew] Warpechowski”, describing a man’s reaction to seeing another impaling his hand deliberately on a nail. Voice of Polish man describing Warpechowski impaling his own hand. Man hits the other. Darkness. Preparation for and performance of “‘Electrical Love Story’ Warpechowski Poland 1979”. Warpechowski’s own comments read over. Still of military man reading at microphone. VO says “We are not trying to change the system. We are trying to change the way the system works… We are trying to return to the real meaning… and sense of an institution.” Photographs of queues of Polish people; VO suggests they are queuing for milk, butter, soap, etc.; talks of the expense of these goods.\u000b\u000b ACE144.4 10:22:58 10:31:17 “‘Romantic Manifestation’ [Jerzy] Bere? Poland 1981”: Bere?, kneeling naked, chops up a board on which the word “exhibition” is painted, arranges the wood into a pyramid shape and sets fire to it. Woman’s VO (in Polish; translated) explains that she saw him perform in the city square in Krakow in 1981, putting bundles of kindling, each with a word on it, into a circle made of the same word, which he then set fire to. The VO notes that this “the last manifestation of spirit”, took place three weeks before martial law was declared. Photograph of snow-covered square with trucks circling around. “‘Meditation for the Condition of Poland’ Natalia LL Poland 1981”: Natalia LL seated, reflected, in angle of windows. Woman’s VO (in Polish and English) explains that younger artists in Poland are highly sensitised to cultural development in the capitalist world. They face a dilemma caused by their own socialist ethos coming up against the cultural dynamic of the West. Darkness. Voices of young women over. Photograph of woman in police officer’s uniform; intercut with photographs of woman walking naked in crowded streets: “‘Self Identification’ Ewa Partum Poland 1980”: Photograph of the two women confronting each other. Woman’s VO (Polish) not translated. Darkness. Man’s VO “In the words of a distant intellectual, Adam Michnik, real Poland has ‘shown itself to be a giant with legs of steel but hands of clay, facing a regime with feet of clay but hands of steel’”. Black and white film of man, watched by audience, smashing iron bar against two table tops. “Ra?a Todosijevi?, Yugloslavia, 1979: ‘East and West. Them and Us. Then and Now.’”\u000b\u000b ACE144.5 10:31:17 10:46:42 Black and white film of man slung by arms and legs between roof beams. ASSOCIATION. “image: ‘The Big Sleep’ Jan Micoch Czechoslovakia 1974”. VO quotes “text: The trial of Milan Knížák Czechoslovakia 1971”: “on St Valentine’s Day last year, 1971, Knížák was sentenced to two years imprisonment ...” for producing art works the authorities didn’t approve of. Woman hangs up dresses; seats herself at sewing machine. Pop music over. Sewing machine arm going up and down; woman’s voice counting. Darkness. “‘Temporary Unlinking’ Sonia Knox N. Ireland 1981”. Woman and dresses. Music, distorted voice, and sound of gargling over. Bere?, naked, painting the soles of his feet, walking and leaving black footprints on the floor. “‘Political Mess’ Bere? Poland 1980” Woman’s voice (in Polish) saying she first saw Bere? in a small village near Gdansk, three weeks after the government had signed the agreement permitting the formation of an independent trade union, and describes the performance. Bere? sets fire to a piece of paper on which he’s painted. Narrator says this work brings up the issue of the reproduction of all performance behaviour, as this was reconstructed, with description supplied by a witness to an earlier performance. Woman’s VO (in English) continues witness report over film of Bere? painting the word “ghost’” on his body. Narrator suggests that “without a witness, the work does not attain artistic or social reality. Without a witness, the work has no existence”. Darkness. Man’s VO: “It is simple. Things are not what they seem to be. On the face of it, past experience doesn’t seem to provide an adequate basis for analysis. In fact, there may be no distinctions to be made between on thing and something else.” “‘Between’ Brisley/Rbertson U.K. 1979”. Two naked men, on slippery incline, shuffle around and shove each other from time to time. Man’s VO continues. ACE144.6 10:46:42 10:55:00 Aerial view of coastline, fields, sand bars, shallow water, cliffs. VO “In Britain there still exist communal rituals, which resist intrusion, for intrusion produces self-consciousness, and self-consciousness destroys the very sense of the ritual.” VO explains that, in 1346, French sailors were frightened away by an army of women from Padstow with a hobby horse in the lead. Aerial view of countryside and of Padstow. Men’s voices singing the “’Obby ’Oss May Song”. Photographs of same procession from early twentieth century. Photographs of hobby horse costumes and rituals from other parts of Europe. Commentary describes the Padstow hobby horse and the Haxey Hood as drama in one of its earliest forms, where the division between action and audience has not yet been institutionalised, and suggests that some contemporary performance seeks to do the same, particularly where they are in opposition to an established regime. Aerial view of Padstow and the nearby sea. Black and white film of man hanging up clothes; woman’s VO “Du denke durch Aktion”. Credits over.\u000b\u000b",

Holmes describes Roussel’s life and work, and Duchamp’s reaction to the stage version of Impressions of Africa. Dramatised scenes from the play.

Watson suggests a reconstruction of events. Holmes talks about Duchamp using methods and materials that had never been used in art before.\u000b\u000b ACE145.6 10:51:38 11:05:19 Rouen, 1913.

ACE145.7 11:05:19 11:16:55 Holmes explains that Walter Ehrenberg had come to own most of the rights in The Large Glass, but sold them to Catherine Dreyer in 1918. Holmes explains how the glass panels were broken during repacking after an exhibition in 1926, though no-one discovered this for ten years. Duchamp says that he loved the breaks. It took a year to restore the panels, but the work was still to fragile to be moved. Replica made by Richard Hamilton for the Tate Gallery. The work was subsequently increasingly well received, Holmes describing it as “the Rosetta Stone of modern art”. Computer Toby and Holmes produce a theoretical and psychoanalytical analysis beginning with Laforgue-like word-play in the title. Duchamp’s voice mentions a childhood memory of fairground targets. A book of children’s popular science experiments and games. Holmes brings in alchemical theories and symbolism as a source from some of the ideas. Young Girl and Man in Spring / Jeune homme et jeune fille dans le printemps (1911): they have a tiny image of Mercury between them.

Watson says his notes are full of questions. Holmes asks if art should be expected to provide answers as questions are more interesting. He describes a door that Duchamp designed to open one room while closing another, thus conflicting with Cartesian logic. ACE145.9 11:24:05 11:31:04 Duchamp’s voice “I don’t care if I am or not…” Toby produces more word games. Duchamp talks about using ready-made artefacts: bicycle wheel, bottle dryer, chemist’s vial, the urinal, etc., thus denying the possibility of defining art. His version of the Mona Lisa.

Film from the 1930s of people working in the same garden space, children playing, women having tea together. Watkins talking about how everyone came to know their neighbours very quickly and how they would all help each other.\u000bCommentary introduces the film as “The biography of a building, a picture of its life, from a range of people with different points of view. Stories of hopes and ideals, but also of decline and decay. The ideas that gave rise to it, and also where those ideas came from. The social circle into which they passed. The gas company which financed it. The stories of the people who have lived in it over two generations. A particular choice of views. Views of Kensal House.”. Architects plans and drawings intercut with shots of buildings and surroundings. Extract from Kensal House (1938), showing houses of the period, local man describing living conditions, Maxwell Fry talking about the Gas, Light and Coke Company building blocks of “working class flats”; models, finished buildings. Alice Cole, Resident 1936-1975, says that she was the first person to move into the block she lived in. Says the flat had hot water and a bath. June Parsons, Resident since 1936, says that her mother couldn’t believe the luxury of having a separate bedroom for the children, and an inside bath and toilet, etc. She says the buildings were known as “the Sunshine Flats”. Caption: “The towpath to the North of Kensal House.” Commentary asks how the designers of the flats imagined life in them. Maxwell Fry says that he and his colleague, Elizabeth Denby, wanted “really liveable flats” and some sort of “urban village life”. Article by Elizabeth Denby. Extract from Kensal House showing children playing. Fry says the flats exemplified their ideas of “what urban life should be for the working classes”. Commentary reads from report in The Times on a paper Denby gave at the RIBA in November 1936, in which she said that working people considered flats to be “inadequate for families whose lives centred in an around the home”. Newspaper advertisements for staff and for holidays, etc. Fry points out that there were communal workrooms and committee rooms in one of the blocks which provided space for activities which couldn’t easily be carried on in a small flat. Cole describes meeting Frank Sainsbury and Elizabeth Denby and being appearing in a film about her little girl and the Kensal House nursery school, and about the women’s social club.\u000b ACE149.3 10:09:33 10:18:31 Extract from film showing Cole, the children and women, and men in the workshops. Jessie Watkins, Resident 1936-1974, talking about the social events. Photographs of dances, bus trips, exercise classes, children’s activities, etc. Cole says they all took on a new lease on life. Fry explains their ideas that flats should have an integral social component and, most important, that the children should have nursery schools. Caption: “Early evening at Portobello Dock.” Commentary asks why the idea of Kensal House was attractive to the company that financed it. Fry talks about the rivalry between the electricity and gas companies, and the forward-looking nature of the Gas, Light and Coke Company who used one of their own derelict sites for a piece of modern housing. Pamphlet, Why Kensal House was built. Commentary quotes from pamphlet explaining “the myth” of the all-electric house. Extract from Kensal House. Margaret & Eva Wilson, Shopkeepers, explain that the Kensal House flats were “all gas”, including the lighting for which the Wilsons’ shop sold gas mantles, and which they still stock. Caption: “The Motorcycle Repair Yard below Southern Row.” Commentary asks how the architects saw the design of the site meeting the needs of the occupiers of the flats. Fry talks about the awkward nature of the site, that it was much lower than the road. Architect’s drawing showing its shape, etc. Views of the buildings; the nursery school on the site of an earlier gas holder which also influenced the shape of the nearer block. Extract from Kensal House shows bridge from the main road across both blocks reducing the need for people to climb steps. “Living” balconies which Fry describes as very important features, and small balconies designed to be drying areas for laundry. The kitchen designed as a place of technology. Fry says that they eliminated corridors to increase space in the other rooms. Extract from Kensal House shows men playing billiards in living room, woman ironing. ACE149.4 10:18:31 10:28:36 Caption: “The Dawn Sky over Kensal House.” Commentary asks what sort of memories remain of Kensal House around the war years. Cole talks about amateur dramatics, and putting on Love on the Dole around 1939. She recites some of her lines. Commentary reads from notice of appointment of Air Raid Warden. The Wilsons relate an anecdote about an air raid. Parsons tells how a tombstone, blown across the road by a bomb, split open a nearby gas holder. Film of empty flat. Woman’s VO talking about a man who committed suicide after the death of his wife. Caption: “The Middle Window of Number 328 Ladbroke Grove.” Commentary asks about the origins and reception of the “new ideas” which inspired the architects. Fry says that, a decade after the Great War, everyone was looking forward to a better future. He saw pictures of Bauhaus, Le Corbusier, and other continental architecture (photographs) and used these ideas in miniature. Stephen Bayley, Victoria & Albert Museum, describes the debate in which people saw flats as “a continental import” which would destroy British urban life. Fry talks about similar attitudes and resistance to change. Caption: “Westminster Lorry Park on Kensal Road.” Commentary asks about the link between the campaign for the modern flat and the cause of “improved housing for workers”. Bayley says that the Modern movement believed that flats were the rational solution to the housing problem, and points out that Britain already had mansion blocks and workers’ tenements. ACE149.5 10:28:36 10:38:47 Henry Roberts’s 1849 “model dwellings for families” in Bloomsbury. Model flats, disguised as cottages, designed by Roberts for Prince Albert in 1851. Caption lists London County Council legislation empowering local authorities to build social housing. St Pancras development, completed 1928. Commentary describes the design of these buildings. Bayley on the influence of German “existence minimum” ideas, and Fry interpreting this to suit English taste. Caption: “The Admiral Blake just South of Kensal House.” Commentary asks about the social circles welcoming the Kensal House ideas and how these ideas were put into practice. Fry talks about meeting Elizabeth Denby, the leading spirit on housing reform, and telling her about his ideas; Denby immediately got him a commission to build a development in South London. Extract from Kensal House showing Denby saying that the flats were designed for families, families on their balconies, boys playing; Denby says the tenants are the people who regulate their own communal lives. Watkins describes Kensal House as “Miss Denby’s baby” and talks about her involvement in it. Cole talks about the financial help that Denby gave to people for their own flats and for the club. Lady Newell, Chairman Feathers Association, talking about visit by Prince of Wales to deprived areas of Wales in 1933, the setting up of Feathers in Kensal Road, and subsequently running the community centre at Kensal House. Photographs of Octavia Hill, pioneer of work with “the deserving poor” in the late nineteenth century. Fry describes Denby as being “passionate” about her work. Caption: “Early Afternoon below the Kensal Green Retort.” Commentary asks when, and for what reasons, in the view of the original tenants, did Kensal House begin to decline? Watkins says that it was around 1940, when people were evacuated and the club was turned into a children’s dinner centre. Extract from Kensal House. Reg Cole (sitting with Alice Cole) says that it was never the same after the war, and was eventually turned into a youth club which excluded the older people. Watkins never the same after the war – no-one had the same organisational skills as Miss Denby, who visited less frequently. Minutes of management meeting of March 1945 noting that Miss Denby would resign at the end of September. Gwen Cole (with Alice and Reg Cole) says that it was originally “well ordered and kind” but was “no longer kind” after the war. ACE149.6 10:38:47 10:46:40 Caption: “Kensal House from All Souls canal bridge.” Commentary says that no single factor can be wholly responsible for the decline of Kensal House and asks if the design itself had something to do with it. Watkins talks about people washing in the inadequately sized kitchens because there were no basins in the bathrooms. Covering letter for copy of “entirely frank” report from December 1942, What the Tenants Think of Kensal House. Extracts from report (read over extracts from Kensal House) particularly on tenants’ views of the kitchens. Stephen Bayley talking about the kitchen as social centre, and thinks that though Modern Movement architecture offered interesting exteriors, interiors were often not responsive to people’s needs. Caption: “The return of the Bristol Train.” Extracts from Kensal House and other footage. Commentary talks about the decreasing level of financial support offered to the flats after the war, saying that the gas company decided to sell the building in 1947, as its publicity value was outweighed by its costs. Fry says he was told that the rents were too low to cover even basic maintenance. The London County Council finally took over the flats in 1951, and used them for social housing. Watkins says that, while the gas company would vet tenants carefully, the LCC didn’t. They hoped that “rough” people would be helped by “decent” people, but in fact the standards brought down. Reg and Alice Cole talking about vandalism and theft. Caption: “Fishermen passing along the Grand Union Canal.” Commentary says that LCC policy was to assign “first grade” tenants to new property and “second grade” to re-lets which is what Kensal House had become without its social facilities. Gwen Cole says that the neighbourhood changed and women felt less safe on the streets. Commentary talks about the break-up of local communities, and the increase in crime. Watkins describes break-ins to her flat. ACE149.7 10:46:40 10:54:59 Caption: “The Waste Chute at the New Flats East of Kensal House.” Railway bridges. Commentary talks about the fear and isolation caused by the break-up of communities, the arrival of new residents from further afield, and thus the disappearance of common experience. Dorette Hawthorne, Tenants Association, says there have been huge changes in the last thirteen years since she arrived, with a high turnover of tenants, many of whom don’t speak English as a first language. Watkins complains about the Council’s strategies for occupancy. Commentary says that, in the 1970s, Kensal House deteriorated to the point where it was set aside for “third category or substandard tenants”, and by the 1980s was being used for single people or families from Asian countries. Parsons says she doesn’t see her neighbours any more; many of the flats are let out on a shared basis. Paul Ryan, Mark Eager, Michael Burges, Resident 1 Year, say there was no curiosity about them when they moved in; the flats are now regarded as “hard to let”. Commentary says that the lack of social cohesion made it difficult for Kensal House to adapt to changes in society at large. Ivor Flint, Resident 2 Years, on the difficulty of getting to know neighbours as there’s nowhere to meet. Thora Skinner, Resident 3 Months, knows two people because they were also in the Refuge that placed her. Burges. Catherine Morencie, Resident 5 Years, counts the few people she knows. Parsons says that, in the old days, everyone knew everyone. Flint comments on a lack of community spirit. Parsons. Hawthorne on problems faced by the Tenants’ Association. Commentary points out changes in use for the former club rooms, one an independently-run youth club, one an independently-run crèche. Fry says that post-war development “brought the whole [Modernist] movement into disrepute” because it was much more commercially minded, and considers that much contemporary work is “not stirring the whole body of architecture as it should”. Commentary talks about the cost of maintaining Kensal House’s social facilities as being too expensive to be extended, after the war, across the country: “The decline of Kensal House was the price of the war, a loss of community feeling still being paid for well beyond Kensal House.” Extracts from Kensal House.

The main subject was the work of Ben Nicholson and parts are included in the Arts Council Film ‘Ben’, directed by John Read on the life of Ben Nicholson.” Patrick Heron talks about his connection with St. Ives to which his family first moved in 1925; gives some of his family background; about some drawings from the early period, one similar to those painted later by Alfred Wallis who first came to St. Ives in 1928. About Ben Nicholson first meeting Wallis, the influence of Wallis’s work on him; descriptions of Wallis’s use of colour, typical of the British avant-garde movement. Heron talks about “education” for painting, best done by painters looking at other people’s paintings. Influences on Nicholson: his father, Winifred Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth. The arbitrary distinctions between figurative and non-figurative painting. ACE150.3 10:08:41 10:21:48 Heron on Nicholson’s “white reliefs”, intended to eliminate figuration; “with time, certain associations accrue to these images”; images are “read back into reality”; facts are relative in their significance and mean different things at different times. The influence on the design world of Nicholson’s organisation of pure circles with pure rectangles. Heron on Nicholson’s “line”, comparing him favourably with Mondrian. Nicholson’s landscapes from Yorkshire and West Cornwall, both places from Heron’s past. On Nicholson’s need for privacy. Heron on Nicholson after he left St. Ives; his work in the 1940s; the influence of Georges Braque. On Nicholson’s still life work; how Cornwall, uniquely among British landscapes, has had an influence on the twentieth century British avant-garde; influence of Picasso and Braque. Nicholson’s “English-ness”; his delicacy (sometimes overdone), his speed. Elements of Cubism and Constructivism. “The greatest English painter since Turner.” On Turner and Constable. ACE150.4 10:21:48 10:30:37 Heron denies any mystical side to Nicholson. On symbols as opposed to images. On Mark Rothko talking about “grace”. Nicholson being very down to earth if sometimes over-complex. On “draftsmanship”; execution and conception go together. He says that Nicholson thought that the meaning of a thing springs from its physical reality. Heron on Nicholson’s studio: neat and tidy, and rather “domesticated”. He says he unconsciously organises objects in his own studio on a rectilinear grid. Heron can’t identify only a single paramount quality in Nicholson’s work. Talks about seeing a seven-foot late Picasso alongside a similarly-dimensioned Nicholson he hadn’t seen before, which he thought “slightly overwhelmed the Picasso”. On Nicholson’s Swiss period, returning to reliefs and mixing different periods. He believes that the two last exhibitions were full of new and “fantastically inventive” work, breaking new ground. ACE150.5 10:30:37 10:37:40 Heron on his comparison between Nicholson and Joan Miró. Talks about Nicholson being very depressed because of the way he was more or less ignored by the Press, and couldn’t sell his work; that he only started to sell in Switzerland. On Nicholson’s “official recognition” through an award of the Order of Merit. Heron on Nicholson’s “immensely strong” work ethic.

Angela Verren talks about Nicholson’s love of certain parts of the English countryside. Nicholson’s flat in Hampstead. Verren explains how Nicholson’s purchase of his plumber’s tools set him off on a new creative period, in which he produced oil-washed drawings based on their shapes. The “five forms” side by side; Verren describes the differences between the different pictures, some of which she feels have “rather an aggressive quality”: others images of these shapes.\u000b\u000b ACE151.8 10:46:23 10:52:08 Heron talks about the “small paintings” of Nicholson’s last years which “looked like Indian ink and 6B pencil”, and “the configuration [of which] was new … there’s nothing more difficult than to discover a new way of dividing up this rectangle … [Nicholson] was breaking new ground…”. Jugs and mugs including May 1978 (single jug) (1978). May 1978 (shadows and lilac) (1978). Exterior of Nicholson’s last home, at Pilgrim’s Lane, Hampstead. Photograph of his collection of glassware and mugs, etc. Verren says that he had trouble with his eyes which made it difficult for him to work, and that he needed companionship and a tranquil atmosphere. Heron describes seeing a “late Picasso” alongside a Nicholson of similar size and thinking that the latter “slightly overwhelmed” the latter. Andras Kalman talks about Nicholson’s work before 1933 and his ability to alternate abstraction with more representational images; he feels that, in the abstract painting, “the placing of the colours, the lines, have a perfection and an elegance which doesn’t appear in either Mondrian or Braque or Picasso … a unique contribution to twentieth century art”. Commentary notes that Nicholson died before completing his last work, “a thirty-foot wall, built in Carrara marble, and based on one of his famous white reliefs”, the Nicholson Wall, at Sutton Place, Surrey.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE152.2 10:00:00 10:08:21 People talking about problems with buildings and maintenance. Bulldozer starts to demolish house. Derelict buildings. Commentary says old buildings of all kinds are vulnerable and need protection. Donald Insall, architect, says we need some criteria on which to base our decisions on which buildings to save. These criteria will be subjective and depend to some extent on the background and training of the person making the decisions. Bringing buildings materials onto a site. Commentary notes that conservation of the past is a relatively new idea, one of today’s good causes, but asks if we really know why we care. Post-war tower blocks and other developments. Commentary suggests that conservation has become a public issue in part because of anger and protest at the destruction that went with the redevelopment, in part because of increased awareness of environmental control and of the quality of people’s lives. \u000bOlder buildings. Commentary by Insall points out that development on war-damaged areas wasn’t confined to Britain, and that the concept of the “conservation area” appeared in both Britain and France during the 1960s. Shots of domestic architecture, preserved and restored. Insall VO wonders if criteria used to define these as worthy of conservation reduce simply to “nostalgia”. Venice. Insall VO points out that a Venetian will care about the city differently from a Neapolitan, and so on. Responses to the past are conditioned by circumstances, by people’s backgrounds and by their interests. Ruins of cities in Poland destroyed by the retreating Germans. Postwar restoration in progress; some of the results. The reconstruction was carried out in a spirit of national survival and resurgence. The recreation of colonial Willliamsburg, U.S.A., begun in 1926, with the aim that “the future may learn from the past”. Every nation or culture saves what it wants to save.\u000b ACE152.3 10:08:21 10:15:08 Commentary describes Chester as adapting, like all the other cities, to life in the 20th century. Town Crier. Tourists. A city of contrasts and mixtures, with a feeling of continuity and evolution. Street scenes showing old buildings next to new. Years of destruction through neglect are now over; Chester is being “cared for”. Commentary says that it’s essential to understand the features of a city that give it its particular style and identity. Roman city wall; the route goes round the city. The mediaeval cathedral. The Very Rev. T.W.I. Cleasby, Dean of Chester, says the cathedral, the Rows, and the Roman walls are the essential features of the city; a survey of visitors revealed that many had come to see the cathedral. Andrew Brown, City Conservation Officer, says that people come to Chester to live, to shop, and as tourists. The conservation programme will keep the city characterful, attractive to visitors and therefore prosperous. The Rows shopping centre, and nearby streets. Conservation is about the buildings themselves and how people relate to them. Insall describes Victorian paintings from Chester City Museum illustrating what Chester might have looked like in earlier times. “Trying to restore things to what they may have been is like trying to put the clock back. Conserving them is about recognising that it has to go forward.” Some of the many Victorian half timbered buildings with which Chester abounds, now a major part of the city’s image. ACE152.4 10:15:08 10:26:51 Portrait and photograph of William Morris, founder of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in 1877, the beginning of the modern conservation movement. Morris suggested that a building “should be valued for everything that time has made of it”. Canal boats in locks. Road traffic, “the most ruthless force for change in human history”. Norfolk countryside. Commentary relates the story of Binham Priory, founded in 1091, now mostly ruined as it was plundered for building stone by Edward Paston, to whom it was given in 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries . This is compared to contemporary destruction of Victorian railway stations and Art Deco cinemas. Insall VO, suggesting that the conservation of Binham Priory is part of the “ancient monuments mentality”, the archaeological tradition of conservation, protecting it from further change. Insall describing the building of the Priory, and indicates how it’s responded to the centuries. He asks how it should be looked after: sustain it or attempt to restore it? Commentary on the enclosed space of the nave, now used as the village church. Organist playing; the organ is relatively recent. Vicar setting up hymn board. Because of current use, this building “is not frozen in history like the ruins outside”. Aerial view of a town. Insall’s VO identifies Lavenham, Suffolk. Period houses – the town’s one remaining economic asset, bought for their property values and picturesque appearance. Commentary asks “But what is picturesque?” Local resident Katharine Carter talking about the colours people have painted their houses. Insall asks which modern taste prevails, to preserve or prettify? Local resident Boris Rickelman. Insall VO suggests that controls are necessary on things like windows, shop fronts, what to do with timber frames. Rickelman says that exposing the beams will ruin them; many house-owners are now plastering over the beams, but that it was struggle to get permission to do this. Katharine Carter. ACE152.5 10:26:51 10:36:57 Presentation of “Europa Nostra” medal to Mayor of Chester. Commentary explains that it was given as the result of the Riverside project in the old city. Tony and Margaret Eaton describe how they became caught up with the Riverside restoration as a result of setting up their own home and shop in the city. Commentary describes how company building underground car park have become involved in conservation. R.S.Oliver of Design & Construction (Oliver) Ltd. On how they found Roman paving on the site, and built an underground chamber to preserve the remains. Insall VO talking about the need for long-term planning, administrative machinery and legal powers. Cyril Morris, Director, Technical Services, says that Chester is unique, the first city to have a conservation policy, and the first to levy a penny rate for conservation. Planning committee meeting attended by Morris and Insall discussing planning applications received. Insall VO describes the pedestrianisation of the city centre. Commentary says that people enjoy a “walkabout city”, but that shops are as important as shoppers. Paul Quellyn Roberts talking about the key to successful pedestrian schemes being access. He would like to be able to adapt for more commercial use a listed building 25 metres behind those in Watergate Road which, like many nearby, is in poor repair, and proper up by iron beams and scaffolding, etc. Commentary points out that commercial enterprise adapted a 12th century vault to modern use. A gathering of architects, including John Topping, who believes that “an architect’s task is to create a space and a place for people, rather than a fashion”; John Collins, President, Cheshire Society of Architects, on the challenge of building in a modern style in keeping with older surroundings; Gilbert Parry, Chairman, Festival of Architecture Committee says an architect will never be “right” in a conservation area, but must try to be sympathetic to surroundings, reflects modern architecture, and pleases the public. \u000b\u000b ACE152.6 10:36:57 10:43:19 Commentary describing the restoration of a near-derelict terrace: a Jacobean hall became a Greek restaurant. Many original features remain. Working on terrace of cottages in Albion Street. Heber Fearnall, Chairman, Muir Group Housing Association, on the role played by the Association in saving Albion Street. Work proceeding. Fearnall says that most of the former residents wanted to return to Albion Street and maintain their community. Albert Dock. Commentary introduces Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, Chairman, Historic Buildings snd Monuments Commission, a new Government initiative, who talks about the move to conserve buildings from the Industrial Revolution, and talks about the redevelopment plans for the docklands area, and the role of the Commission. Sign for The Priory in Lavenham, Suffolk, kept open to the public by its private owners, Alan and Gwenneth Casey. Alan Casey talks about the building and how they turned it from a derelict structure into something approaching its original appearance. Various shots before and after the work. Commentary says that choices in such work are inevitably personal and can be difficult to resolve.\u000b\u000b ACE152.7 10:43:19 10:51:23 The Binham village church. The vicar, Reverend Godfrey Farnworth, talks about some twentieth century features in the eleventh century building, particularly the heaters which had to be made retractable so that they did not obscure sight of unique carvings, etc. Reverend Farnworth shows a screen in which the original decorations of saints had been painted over with Bible texts during the Commonwealth period, and which are now becoming visible again. He also points to the problems of the West Window. Commentary explains that the West Window as bricked up in 1809 as the brickwork was too decayed to be safe. It would be possible to put in a new copy of the original (pictures of it exist), but the bricked-up façade is itself now an historical feature. Voices of local people over give their opinions on what should be done. The vicar is in favour of replacing it. Donald Insall suggests that the degree to which things can be conserved or preserved may depend on their scale and complexity. A single stone or similar monument can be protected; preserving a village comes up against the issue of people and their community; at city level, things like land values come into play as well.

Melbourne explains that Forsyth was friends with the editor of the local newspaper, and thus could maintain a flow of news stories about Burslem School of Art. Newspaper photos of students.

Melbourne explains that Forsyth was able to get manufacturers to support the art schools.

Cooper explains that Forsyth suggested she go to work for A E Gray, where he had been when he designed these vases. Vase. Cooper was able to do her own work on time-work basis rather than on piece rates as she had started out.

The women. Melbourne explains that the numbers of people involved meant that they could turn out ware in relatively large quantities (and at low cost because of low wages). Paintress says they earned 5/7d (roughly 28p) a week. Paintresses: they were paid 5/9d a week (29p) during six months apprenticeship. Photo of pottery buildings with women leaving work. Paintress talks about deductions for training. Paintress describes her earnings: 6/0d (30p) a week for six months, eventually moving up to a take-home of 15/0d (75p), even after a third of her earnings had been deducted for her apprenticeship. Cooper was “brought down to earth” by the “unforeseen side” of the work. Melbourne believes that Cliff, Cooper and Rhead all acknowledged the debt they owed to the School. He thinks that there would have been less recognition at the time of their creative talents, though they would have been seen as energetic leaders of a new movement. Credits.",

Paintress talks about deductions for training. Paintress describes her earnings: 6/0d (30p) a week for six months, eventually moving up to a take-home of 15/0d (75p), even after a third of her earnings had been deducted for her apprenticeship. Cooper was “brought down to earth” by the “unforeseen side” of the work. Melbourne believes that Cliff, Cooper and Rhead all acknowledged the debt they owed to the School. He thinks that there would have been less recognition at the time of their creative talents, though they would have been seen as energetic leaders of a new movement. Credits.",

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE160.2 10:00:00 10:09:29 Panning high angle shot of Londonderry in winter. Shot continues to include the Bogside “Free Derry Corner” sign, “You are now entering Free Derry”. VOs talk about public images of Derry; intercut news pictures. Children tobogganing. News pictures from computer file. Two people (Dave Fox and Sylvia Stevens) spreading out photographs on a table. “A war of pictures … about how places are seen and remembered through those pictures” says VO. Printing press. Willie Carson, (photojournalist, Derry) looking at proof, his VO talking about his book Derry Through the Lens begun in 1974, and a more recent publication called A Decade and a Half. Carson’s VO continues over photographs of the city. Carson talking about images of the city and about his work; photographs on the walls of his room. He says that while many of the images show the beauty of the city, many carry a foreboding of something about to happen; none is the only truth. Clive Limpkin (Fleet Street photographer), talking about being sent to Derry in August 1969. His VO continues over winter scene of the city, describing the riot that started after a march had apparently concluded peacefully. Pages of photographs. Limpkin describes fleeing after he and other journalists were attacked because people assumed they were on the side of the Catholics, and how he came to realise the long history preceding these events. ACE160.3 10:09:29 10:20:15 Photographs of events on Bloody Sunday. Fox and Stevens at the table. “How can we tell what these pictures mean?” Eamonn Melaugh (photographer, Derry) describing events of Bloody Sunday (January 30th, 1972), pointing out where people were shot during an anti-internment march. Newspaper reports and photographs. Countryside. VO of Terry Fincher (international photojournalist) saying that he’d covered ‘quite a lot of conflict’ since the mid-1950s; he believes that Northern Ireland is receiving less coverage that in the 1970s and he feels it important to keep the issues affecting this part of Britain in the public consciousness. Some of his photographs. He points out that photographs can be misinterpreted – shows one of his images from Aden – and argues that photographers want to keep their pictures as truthful as possible. Inside Camerawork (community photography project, Derry), with a montage of images on display. Camerawork worker describes a project they did on young people when they made a decision not to show images of the war. Other Camerawork workers talk about how people make money out of images of suffering and anguish, and only appear to be interested in “the bad bits” of Derry. They want people who are part of the local community to be able to produce their own images and decide what outsiders should see. ACE160.4 10:20:15 10:28:35 Fox and Stevens looking at The Year in Pictures and other collections; VO says that news photographs make people feel familiar with places they really know nothing about. There is no room to question the background to published photographs. Watching video of troops and stone-throwers at Butcher’s Gate. Barney McMonagle (photographer, Derry), visible in previous video, talking about the “free Derry” riots of August 1969; some of his photographs. He talks about his excitement at seeing photographs of rioting developing. His children looking through his albums. He says that photographers were always hanging around Free Derry Corner hoping some disturbance would occur. McMonagle says he stopped taking photographs in 1973 when his long-lens camera was mistaken for a gun and he was shot at. High angle shot of Derry. Book of photographs. Limpkin VO and describing how he knows which images his employers will find most desirable even while he’s taking them, and how photographers compare notes at the end of a day’s work. Picture of young boy in gas mask and other images from the disturbances. ACE160.5 10:28:35 10:34:13 Ian Berry (international photojournalist) at his home, talking about his experiences of working in Northern Ireland. Some of Berry’s photographs, which he took almost by chance, of British troops beating up two youths. Berry says that the first newspaper he tried to sell these pictures to said they couldn’t use them. Another of the photographs. Berry says he was advised to leave Northern Ireland, but then discovered that a newspaper had published only his photographs of the youths throwing stones at the patrol which made him popular with the Army. Photograph of troops on the receiving end of missiles. Bryn Campbell (picture editor, London) says that what appears in newspapers is always a choice. He says that some photographers like to cover conflict situations in order to show what they can do. Talks about restrictions on taking pictures in the Falklands; suggests that more photographers should have been allowed to go there, but understands concerns about showing pictures of dead people on the British side. ACE160.6 10:34:13 10:44:52 Fox and Stevens looking at magazine images, “a bit of the world in miniature”. “Conflict is seen as out there and foreign.” Derry landscape. The Camerawork workers, talking about the reception their exhibition received from young people in London, some surprised at the ‘normality’ of life in Derry, while young Black people were able to identify with people who were being harassed by the police. The same exhibition at the art college in Farnham got a different reception: some of the audience considered the photographs to be ‘heavy’ and asked about scenery subjects. One of the Camerawork women points out that non-one can “be sure who’s hiding behind bushes and trees” – her husband was shot from ambush. Landscape. Mounting a photograph titled Unseen – to the Border; one called Undercover – by the River. Willie Doherty (artist, Derry) talking about the unseen being that which impinges most on one’s life. Photographs titled Surveillance, Stifling – Last Hours of Daylight, Shrouding Pervading – Fog Ice, The Sleep of Reason – Drizzle Overcast. Romantic images with underlying undercover activity. Surveillance is continual. R.U.C (photographer, Derry), official police photographer talking while he travels by car to a border checkpoint. He refuses to allow filming as they near it. Some official images:a general view of an area; photographer at work; views of the scene; evidential photographs. Man says people can be identified even if they’re wearing masks. Talks about dramatic photographs taken by photojournalists contrasting with the more “factual” material they gather themselves. ACE160.7 10:44:52 10:56:24 Fox and Stevens with one of the RUC’s albums. The non-action pictures “contain most information”. Quoting the police manual on court evidence saying that professional-looking photographs usually carry more weight than amateur material; “legal photographs should be rich in information but not expensive in appearance”. Helicopter. Woman taking photographs. Film of mourners laying flowers. Looking at albums with Eileen Robson (photographer, Derry): family and friends, weddings, etc. Photographs of events of Bloody Sunday (not taken by her), photographs of hunger strike “calendar”; a letter written on toilet paper, smuggled out of prison. An album of hunger strike photographs. The table of photographs. “How do you make sense of these pictures? ... Can you get away from a photography that is based on spying or based on the laws of the market?” Camerawork workers talking about murals leading young people to become interested in photography, along with a revival in the Irish language. View over rooftops to the “Free Derry” marker, and a photographer. Credits.",

Richard Foster, Director, National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside, touring museum. His VO says that marketing is about providing people with the knowledge of what the organisation does and “enticement to come and try it.” Judy Grahame, Marketing Director, The London Philharmonic, says that marketing can help but must be seen as a philosophy adopted by the whole organisation.

Box Office staff explaining ticket offer to customer; front of house scenes before performance.

Her VO saying that she wanted to give the organisation a more populist image. Jane Glover, who devised a series of programmes based on Mozart’s life.

People picking up and reading programmes; musicians; Honeyman’s VO saying that the promoters have to be satisfied as well as the public; the orchestra can now sell out in venues that don’t usually offer classical music. She believes that artistic direction and marketing must be properly co-ordinated, and that general managers should also be involved in reaching audiences and selling the right image.

National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside.” Publicity materials for the seven establishments, both paying and free admission, which make up this Liverpool-area grouping, designated in 1986, following the abolition of the Metropolitan County Council.

Albert Dock; Foster and others looking at publicity materials Foster’s VO on the decision to publish Focus which uses a considerable portion of available resources; he suggests presenting the Museum as “the answer to a problem”, the general audience’s “problem of how to spend time”; he talks about using the tabloid press very successfully to reach a wide audience, and how national newspapers considered this approach newsworthy in itself.

Maitland VO says the venues didn’t really think they had ready-made dance audiences and that research revealed that the audiences were generally composed of people aged between 26 and 35; she therefore wants to prioritise the development of a young audience, as well as to encourage repeat visits (which requires the box office to keep statistics). Her VO says that 43% of the audience hadn’t visited the venue before, only 22% of the audience were keen dance-goers, 36% had never been to a dance event before; the language used in publicity had to change to take account of such factors, and comments from the public became more important than press quotes. Maitland’s VO talks about educating her management board about the workings of the company and its marketing policy which has made them more involved and active; she works closely with the director and the administrator who have both contributed to a five-year marketing plan, though she feels more could be achieved with better resources.

Sue Runyard says that the first priority is to know your audience, and talks about how Merseyside’s research brought some surprises in this respect. Commentary sums up the Merseyside museums and galleries research programme with captions: “Presenting to a Broader Public/In a Carefully Targeted Way”, “Careful Examination of the Product”, “Marketing and Curatorial Staff Working Together”, “Media and Messages Carefully Chosen”. Yvonne Brewster describes how the Talawa Theatre Company discusses target and targeting audiences, offers particular plays to particular audiences, and engages particular actors who will fit best with the overall brief.

Women in cafés, etc. “… men compel her to assume the status of ‘the other’.” Kate Millett, Writer, talking about the book, how it was received, and how women who read it were labelled “maladjusted”, etc. Ann Oakley, Sociologist and Writer, talks about de Beauvoir being a very important role model, “the mother … that some of us wished we’d had ourselves”. Angie Pegg, Further Education Teacher, was angry with her mother for suggesting that home should come before university studies and thinking that de Beauvoir would have been more encouraging. Books by de Beauvoir. The programme looks at the influence she has had worldwide through her life and work, forty years after the publication of The Second Sex. La Rotonde, Paris, above which de Beauvoir was born. Photographs of her family and her early life; her description of her mother and father’s different ideas and approaches to life, “the reason why [she] became an intellectual”, though “to train for a profession was a sign of defeat”. Ann Oakley on first being given a copy of The Second Sex; her life at the time; deciding to do her PhD on women and housework, much to the confusion of male academics. She read The Second Sex in the course of her studies, and found its message that there was room for change, as well as its breadth of focus, very inspiring. She thinks that de Beauvoir didn’t come to see the positive side of motherhood as she never had children herself.

The farmhouse in Alsace where Hélène lived with her husband; Hélène painting; de Beauvoir’s description of her sister’s work, “…a delicate balance between formal invention and allusion to reality” over. Hélène talks about her relationship with her sister, about their parents, and about neither of them having children. Original film of Marseilles. De Beauvoir’s description of taking a job there, and not considering marrying Sartre even though this might have led to a double posting. Jenny Turner, Writer, says she decided to study philosophy because she knew de Beauvoir had done so. She bemoans the lack of “public life”, cafés, etc., and talks about de Beauvoir and Sartre visiting Edinburgh and finding it impossible to get a cup of tea. Turner talks about The Force of Circumstance (La Force des choses, 1963), and “being completely grabbed by the sense of history being lived through”. She reads from Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter (Mémoires d'une jeune fille rangée, 1958) de Beauvoir’s description of refusing to eat certain foods – Turner talks about this “linking of ideas with feeling”. Paris street scenes, Sartre at a café; German troops, etc.; de Beauvoir’s descriptions of life just after the Munich Crisis and of the Occupation. Marta Zabaleta Hinrichsen, Political Refugee, describes being given a copy of Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter by her mother. Photographs of Hinrichsen and her family. She talks about writing to de Beauvoir because she disagreed with something from the second volume of autobiography, and receiving a positive reply. Photographs of Hinrichsen as a student in Chile; she describes events of the coup, and wanting to physically distance herself from these “subversive” books; she was comforted by the thought that de Beauvoir cared about people in such situations and would have helped if she could.

Commentary talks about the Existentialist movement. De Beauvoir and Sartre leaving their house. Commentary says that the success of de Beauvoir’s first novel, She Came to Stay (L'Invitée, 1943), enabled her to give up teaching and concentrate on her writing. Marge Piercy, Writer, talking about dressing like Juliette Greco which was both “aesthetically satisfying [and] dirt cheap”. Photograph of her with her French husband; his conventional ideas inhibited her, and reading The Second Sex gave her a vocabulary to articulate and analyse her thoughts. Piercy talking about discovering in the autobiographies that de Beauvoir seemed able to retain her sense of integrity without giving up her life as a woman. She talks about her own intellectual and emotional life, and about de Beauvoir’s relationship with Sartre. Description of The Mandarins (Les Mandarins, 1954); photographs of de Beauvoir with Nelson Algren and with Sartre. Her autobiography on the possibility of “reconciliation between fidelity and freedom”. Eva Figes, Writer, considers that de Beauvoir and Sartre’s relationship was not an equal one; though de Beauvoir may suggest that “a free and equal relationship” is possible, in her case it was not so. Photograph of Figes with her family. She started writing after her marriage broke up, wanting to be politically involved, to write literary criticism, to be “engaged”; she re-read The Second Sex but found that it was no help: it was old-fashioned, ambivalent about, and didn’t discuss major debating points concerning female sexuality, and starting from accepted norms rather than turning arguments on their head. Schoolgirls in class; library. De Beauvoir’s description of researching and writing The Second Sex, its reception by the public, and the insulting language used about her. Pegg talks feeling depressed and panicked by her situation and, through reading The Second Sex, realising that she was not unique, that most women live their lives through men who are in the “outside” world. She decided to go to university, despite resistance from her husband, felt guilty, and had to juggle home life and study. She reads de Beauvoir’s words on the role of wife/cook/housekeeper. Pegg believes that, though de Beauvoir was Sartre’s “other”, her work will endure longer than his. ACE182.5 10:37:59 10:47:44 Photographs of de Beauvoir and Claude Lanzmann. Her words over on giving up “certain aspects of love” after the age of 40, but, though promising herself that she “would dutifully retire to the shelf”, she did not. A Very Easy Death (Une mort très douce, 1964), de Beauvoir’s book about her mother’s death; excerpt read over. Photographs of de Beauvoir with her mother; copies of the book in several languages. Film of de Beauvoir with Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir; her description of their relationship read over. Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir, Adopted Daughter of Simone, shows photographs and other memorabilia in de Beauvoir’s studio. She talks about their relationship, saying that de Beauvoir thought all relationships were possible. She says that de Beauvoir enjoyed the company of feminists but did not agree with separatist politics, and that Sartre was a feminist even though his treatment of women was “old-fashioned”, and was very encouraging of de Beauvoir when she wrote The Second Sex. Interview with Sartre and de Beauvoir in which he talks about feminism and his agreement with its principles, though he wonders if the struggle for separatism is correct; de Beauvoir says he may agree with the principles but he does not share “what is called ‘the lived experience’ of women” which is why she and Sylvie and can both “attack” him. De Beauvoir says that their relationship has always come before any relationships they’ve had with other people. She talks about her reasons for not having children. ACE182.6 10:47:44 10:59:53 Footage of de Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir at feminist demonstration in Paris; commentary says that she and other well-known women signed a declaration that they had had illegal abortions. Millett talks about meeting de Beauvoir once a year and comments that it was strange for her to find a writer being acclaimed as as much of a celebrity as a film star. She says that talking to de Beauvoir always “reminded [her] of the purpose” of their work, and that she could not have written Sexual Politics without The Second Sex. Millett describes the differences of approach in their work, and talks at length about the importance of de Beauvoir’s autobiographical writing to her generation. She considers Old Age (La Vieillesse, 1970) “a very subversive book”, as important as The Second Sex. Woman feeding birds; elderly people out walking. De Beauvoir words about people’s reaction to learning that she’s writing about old age, how society expects older people no longer to have the same feelings as younger ones, but to “display serenity”, and how everyone should be concerned about old age and try to make it bearable for everyone. De Beauvoir and Sartre playing draughts; commentary says that she became his main carer when he lost his sight. Reading from her book Adieux: A Farewell to Sartre (La Cérémonie des adieux, 1981) over film of Sartre’s funeral procession and of de Beauvoir at the graveside. Photographs of de Beauvoir. Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir talks about de Beauvoir’s last years, during which she drank too much and took too many pills. Part of French television announcement (on Vingt Heures) of de Beauvoir’s death. Millett says de Beauvoir’s life was “exemplary”. Piercy talks about her reactions to hearing of her death. Oakley doesn’t believe that de Beauvoir achieved the (perhaps impossible) “ideal of the independent woman”, though her writing documents the struggle and the contradictions inherent in the attempt. Photographs of the funeral; Millett on de Beauvoir’s part in French history and culture, and on the need to internalise her legacy. De Beavoir and Sartre’s headstone; reading from de Beauvoir’s writing on wanting to change the world, not her place in it. Credits.",

Eva Figes, Writer, considers that de Beauvoir and Sartre’s relationship was not an equal one; though de Beauvoir may suggest that “a free and equal relationship” is possible, in her case it was not so. Photograph of Figes with her family. She started writing after her marriage broke up, wanting to be politically involved, to write literary criticism, to be “engaged”; she re-read The Second Sex but found that it was no help: it was old-fashioned, ambivalent about, and didn’t discuss major debating points concerning female sexuality, and starting from accepted norms rather than turning arguments on their head. Schoolgirls in class; library. De Beauvoir’s description of researching and writing The Second Sex, its reception by the public, and the insulting language used about her. Pegg talks feeling depressed and panicked by her situation and, through reading The Second Sex, realising that she was not unique, that most women live their lives through men who are in the “outside” world. She decided to go to university, despite resistance from her husband, felt guilty, and had to juggle home life and study. She reads de Beauvoir’s words on the role of wife/cook/housekeeper. Pegg believes that, though de Beauvoir was Sartre’s “other”, her work will endure longer than his.",

Her words over on giving up “certain aspects of love” after the age of 40, but, though promising herself that she “would dutifully retire to the shelf”, she did not. A Very Easy Death (Une mort très douce, 1964), de Beauvoir’s book about her mother’s death; excerpt read over. Photographs of de Beauvoir with her mother; copies of the book in several languages. Film of de Beauvoir with Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir; her description of their relationship read over. Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir, Adopted Daughter of Simone, shows photographs and other memorabilia in de Beauvoir’s studio. She talks about their relationship, saying that de Beauvoir thought all relationships were possible. She says that de Beauvoir enjoyed the company of feminists but did not agree with separatist politics, and that Sartre was a feminist even though his treatment of women was “old-fashioned”, and was very encouraging of de Beauvoir when she wrote The Second Sex. Interview with Sartre and de Beauvoir in which he talks about feminism and his agreement with its principles, though he wonders if the struggle for separatism is correct; de Beauvoir says he may agree with the principles but he does not share “what is called ‘the lived experience’ of women” which is why she and Sylvie and can both “attack” him. De Beauvoir says that their relationship has always come before any relationships they’ve had with other people. She talks about her reasons for not having children.",

            "desc" : "Footage of de Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir at feminist demonstration in Paris; commentary says that she and other well-known women signed a declaration that they had had illegal abortions. Millett talks about meeting de Beauvoir once a year and comments that it was strange for her to find a writer being acclaimed as as much of a celebrity as a film star. She says that talking to de Beauvoir always “reminded [her] of the purpose” of their work, and that she could not have written Sexual Politics without The Second Sex. Millett describes the differences of approach in their work, and talks at length about the importance of de Beauvoir’s autobiographical writing to her generation. She considers Old Age (La Vieillesse, 1970) “a very subversive book”, as important as The Second Sex. Woman feeding birds; elderly people out walking. De Beauvoir words about people’s reaction to learning that she’s writing about old age, how society expects older people no longer to have the same feelings as younger ones, but to “display serenity”, and how everyone should be concerned about old age and try to make it bearable for everyone. De Beauvoir and Sartre playing draughts; commentary says that she became his main carer when he lost his sight. Reading from her book Adieux: A Farewell to Sartre (La Cérémonie des adieux, 1981) over film of Sartre’s funeral procession and of de Beauvoir at the graveside. Photographs of de Beauvoir. Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir talks about de Beauvoir’s last years, during which she drank too much and took too many pills. Part of French television announcement (on Vingt Heures) of de Beauvoir’s death. Millett says de Beauvoir’s life was “exemplary”. Piercy talks about her reactions to hearing of her death. Oakley doesn’t believe that de Beauvoir achieved the (perhaps impossible) “ideal of the independent woman”, though her writing documents the struggle and the contradictions inherent in the attempt. Photographs of the funeral; Millett on de Beauvoir’s part in French history and culture, and on the need to internalise her legacy. De Beavoir and Sartre’s headstone; reading from de Beauvoir’s writing on wanting to change the world, not her place in it. Credits.",

Burrows’s VO talking about the curious relationship between the Jonathan Burrows Group and the Royal Ballet in which a small contemporary dance group has developed out of a larger organisation; he has stayed linked to the Royal ballet because this allows him the resources he needs to make his own work. Burrows walking through backstage corridors and store rooms; his VO talking about trying “to ignore arbitrary divisions between contemporary dance and ballet”. Burrows rehearsing dancers. His VO talking about finding classical ballet too physically challenging; his projects having been done in spare time with dancers giving up lunch breaks, etc.; needing space to work in his own way. Rehearsal. VO says he has chosen to work with particular dancers, each of whom has an individual way of moving, and it prepared to try to do things in a different way. Rehearsal. Dancers talking about some of the differences between classical and contemporary dance. Burrows VO talking about being autocratic and having strong ideas about what he wants to happen. Burrows worries that three recent projects, Hymns, Dull Morning, and Stoics, all reached exactly the same audience and didn’t attract anyone new, and suggests that the contemporary dance audience is suspicious of anything linked to classical ballet. Rehearsal at The Place. Burrows VO says he would like more concentrated rehearsal periods, and to be able to tour more with his Group, but working with the Royal Ballet imposes constraints; he wonders about trying to find funding elsewhere. Jeremy Isaacs, General Director, The Royal Opera House, says that they would be sorry to see Burrows and his Group leave the Royal Ballet. Rehearsal. Burrows VO on wanting to go wherever he could continue his choreography and extend his audience. Kate Flatt, Choreographer, and VO talking about Burrows’s drive to create new work. Programme for performance of Stoics at The Place. People at box office and in restaurant. Dancers preparing. Burrows VO talking about the “violence” of the movement, and the audience response to it.

ACE229.3 10:11:43 10:22:56 Sir Kenneth MacMillan, Principal Choreographer of The Royal Ballet, talking about Burrows’s work, its “organic” nature and its “punctuation”. Anthony Dowell, Director, The Royal Ballet, and VO on Burrows’s choreography. Further excerpt from Stoics. Burrows on his reasons for using The Blue Danube waltz. Further excerpt from Stoics. All four dancers. ACE229.4 10:22:56 10:31:08 The Reverend & Mrs Burrows. Reverend Burrows VO on the long conversations he has with his son. Dancers in dressing room.

Burrows inside White Lodge, talks about the School’s aim to turn out people with “the right temperament and attitude”. Flatt on Burrows’s interests outside dancing itself. Burrows talking about the “composition” course on choreography, and that Flatt and her co-tutor would urge their pupils to question what they did. Flatt on Burrows’s development. David Gothard, Riverside Studios 1978-1986, on how Burrows and others would work through the night at the Studios and would be influenced by each other. Burrows talking about becoming involved with Rosemary Butcher. Rosemary Butcher, Choreographer, says she was impressed by Burrows’s understanding of the modern dance movement. Burrows on working with Butcher. Photographs from Touch the Earth (1987) Butcher VO. Judith Mackrell, Dance Critic “The Independent”, on the intelligence of Burrows’s characterisations.

Dowell and VO (Burrows “Rehearsing the Kangaroo Rat solo from David Bintley’s Penguin Café”) on how often Burrows is cast in small but important roles. Burrows and others performing a rapper sword dance in the piazza at Covent Garden. Burrows VO on learning Morris dancing at White Lodge, and how the very specific technique of Morris dancing has crept into his work. Flatt says that the inclusion of Morris technique in Burrows’s work has been organic rather than deliberate. Reverend Burrows agrees that Morris has influenced his son’s work, but adds that there has also been a rebellion against the traditional classical form. ACE229.5 10:31:08 10:40:08 Pages from Burrows’s grandfather’s diaries, the basis for Dull Morning. Reverend Burrows’s VO saying how moved he was at this. Burrows talking about the “sad repetition” of the entries, each one beginning and ending with a comment about the weather, and with highlights being relatively insignificant events. DULL MORNING (1989). Rehearsal. Burrows VO on how he sees his future, the nature of dance, the impossibility of understanding dance “verbally”. Burrows VO on his use of video to create a “movements diary”. Isaacs believes that Burrows will one day create larger works which could be performed by the Royal Ballet if Burrows wants them to be. Gothard believes Burrows has the capacity to become a “key British choreographer”. Isaacs would like to be able to fund new ventures. Gothard says that, in France, Burrows’s work would be properly subsidised. Burrows talks about a lack on money in Britain which can make it seem that not very much is happening when compared with Belgium and Holland. ACE229.6 10:40:08 10:53:00 Burrows says he see himself as making “dance”, not “ballet” or “contemporary” dance. HYMNS (1988), to harmonium accompaniment.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE249.2 10:00:00 10:07:04 Amsterdam at night. Commentary says “No-one can resist The Committee… One word from them, and millions of dollars can disappear.” Details from Rembrandt’s Night Watch (The Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenhurch) (1642). Commentary says The Committee “can make a Rembrandt vanish, overnight”. Pieter van Thiel talking about Rembrandt paintings. Commentary says Committee believes far too many paintings have been attributed to Rembrandt and wants to put this right. Paintings – Self Portrait of Rembrandt with Gorget (c.1629) The Prophet Jeremiah Mourning over the Destruction of Jerusalem (1630), Self Portrait at the Age of 63 (1669). Van Thiel says Committee is interested in authenticating real Rembrandt work and in correctly classifying those paintings which are not actually by him. Commentary says that the number of “authentic” Rembrandts has fallen from around 1000 at the beginning of the 20th century to around 300. Volumes of the Rembrandt Research Project’s publication, A Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings. Van Thiel describes the arrangement of this work. Otto Naumann, Art Dealer, says the sheer size of the Project makes it essential source. Young Man in a Turban (1631) from the Queen’s Collection Nativity / Holy Family (1640) from the Louvre, Portrait of Philip Lukasz from London’s National Portrait Gallery. Portrait of a Man (1632) and Portrait of a Woman (1632) from the Metropolitan Museum, New York. Naumann says that dealers want to know what information is in the Project’s files.

Duke of Westminster says he doesn’t really mind if the paintings are or are not by Rembrandt; he’s only interested in the quality of the work which hasn’t changed even though the attribution has. Bruyn explains why the Committee’s ideas have changed since they did authenticate these paintings in 1985: as they learn more, their ideas develop. Brown gives reasons why he believes the paintings are by Rembrandt; he compares them with the Self Portrait (1640) and the Portrait of Agatha Bas, Wife of Nicolas van Bambeeck (1641). Van de Wetering, Brown and Bruyn all give their opinions, comparing the two sets of portraits, and talk generally about the authentication process.

Liedtke explains his views. Self Portrait (1661). Brown argues that some paintings are less accomplished than others as Rembrandt’s particular interest was in biblical subjects and his portraits were done out of financial necessity. The Angel Stopping Abraham from Sacrificing Isaac to God (1635). Van de Wetering saying that it’s not a question of “great art”; Carel Fabritius’s self portrait, Young Man in a Fur Cap (1654). Portrait of a Man (1647), Portrait of a Lady (1647) (both from Duke of Westminster’s collection) which commentary says “seem to be authentic”, are now attributed, by the Committee, to Fabritius. Gary Schwartz, Rembrandt Biographer, says the Project “concentrates entirely on handwork”. Brown says all evidence comes from interpretation of the pictures; there is no external testimony about Rembrandt’s working practices. Schwartz says there’s “a gap” between the Committee’s evidence-gathering and the conclusions they draw. Bruyn defending the Committee’s “credibility gap”. Schwartz admires the Committee for refusing to be influenced by earlier judgements, but believes its reputation is not sufficient authority for all the attributions it now makes. \u000b\u000b ACE249.6 10:38:17 10:47:36 Frick Collection, New York.

Gilane Tawadros, Director, Institute of New International Visual Arts. “Mainstream critics have not wanted to engage with work of artists who they define as marginal… as if you have to be from the same culture in order to have anything to say…” Jeyasingh talks of the first headline she remembers about her work, “Madras dancer curries favour”, and notes than things have changed since then.

Nairne VO over classical Roman sculptures: the struggle has been against established white male “norm”. Chila Burman, Artist, on difficulty for Asian working class women to go through “the system”. Burman VO over classical sculptures and paintings: the systems are white middle-class institutions. Burman: survival in that set-up is tough; she has been lucky to have come along during the growth of the Black arts movement, but it’s much harder for younger artists who don’t have the same level of support. Asian paintings and photographs. Burman: artists who started out, like her, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, are now almost mainstream. Asian paintings and photographs. Street scenes – Asian women, Asian shops, etc. VO says that the number of racist attacks on Asians continues to rise, but, though Asian artists are very much concerned by this, they don’t want to confine themselves to commenting on issues of racism or migration. Gilroy: Asians are complex people and can offer the world a new way of looking at identity. It doesn’t have to be just one thing or another. Jeyasingh: creativity comes from personal desire; worrying about whether or not that creation is multicultural is far from foremost in an artist’s mind. To Reflect An Intimate Part of The Red (1981), by Anish Kapoor. Kapoor’s studio. VO names him as “one of Britain’s most acclaimed contemporary artists”, representing Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1990, and winner of the Turner prize in 1991.

Kapoor says he’s interested in what art can do and what he can do as an artist. This raises questions such as “what can a contemporary attitude be towards the poetic… towards the sublime?” Kapoor sculptures. Kapoor VO: his Indian-ness may change the way his work is seen, but in terms of the “human story”, it’s a minor detail. Nairne: artists like Kapoor not only create influential work, but cause “interruptions” in people’s assumptions, e.g., demonstrating at Venice that British artists are not all white and British-born. It also shows the complexity of different cultural relations. Kapoor walking round To Reflect An Intimate Part of The Red. Kapoor VO wants the opportunity to be creative in every part of his existence. Classical Western sculptures. Catalogue of Hayward Gallery exhibition, “The Other Story”. Tawadros talking about the response to “The Other Story” and to a Kapoor exhibition running at the same time at the Lisson Gallery: several critics started their pieces on “The Other Story” by defining it as work by Afro-Caribbean and Asian artists, all of whom are Black, but explained that Kapoor “describes himself as an artist first and an Indian second”, and finds the “contest” set up between identity and art “insidious”. Gilroy worries that such defining reduces the role of the artist to that of propagandist.\u000b\u000b\u000b ACE273.9 10:41:01 10:50:00 Kapoor sculptures. Kapoor refuses to accept that his use of pigment is “quintessentially Indian”. Kapoor sculpture. Kapoor: if it’s Indian, so be it; if it isn’t, it isn’t. The point is “how” is his engagement with the work. Kapoor sculpture. Kapoor. It has a relationship with the body that is direct and passionate. Kapoor sculpture. Kapoor VO on how he’s been working towards a “tactile” emotional sense, looking for fast and durable emotional responses. Kapoor sculpture; VO Bhabha. Bhabha is excited by the way in which Kapoor’s work refuses to be “settled” into national or cultural representation or identity. Kapoor sculpture. Kapoor: “the reality of being Asian in Britain is very important to me”; he feels very passionate about racism, etc. Street scenes. Kapoor VO on how racism and other issues affect him every day. But, as an artist… Kapoor sculptures. Kapoor VO continues. Kapoor: … those issues aren’t given central focus. Making art is a deeply political act. Kapoor sculpture: Kapoor VO: the poetic act is itself a political act. Kapoor: … and he therefore doesn’t feel the need to make a work “in protest”. Romance With Footnotes (1994) by the Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company. The Caucasian Chalk Circle performed by the Tara Arts Theatre Company. Jeyasingh: it’s increasingly difficult to define culture in terms of nations. Notions of “home” are more important. Verma: England is now “home” for him. His notions of England must intersect with those of someone whose birth and background are entirely English, and it is those intersecting points that will enable a new form of Englishness to emerge. The Caucasian Chalk Circle performance. Jeyasingh talks of the “slow battle” to become part of British culture; one day the British Council may even send them to India as being representative of British culture.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE274.2 10:00:00 10:05:46 View of Kingston, Jamaica, “capital of reggae music… a place where the memory of slavery remains close to the surface of life… where … music and dance retain the special power endowed in them by longs years of terror and brutality.” Local cultural forms have come from Christianity and surviving African traditions. Hip hop and dancehall were confirmed as part of world music in 1992 when deejay Shabba Ranks won his second Grammy award. In 1991, Ice Cube’s gangsta rap album Death Certificate reached the top of the American charts. The new music is “a complicated tale of sex, death, religion and redemption in which the aftershocks of slavery can still be felt.” Dancehall deejay Buju Banton is a central figure in the new music; his banned recording Boom Bye Bye “has come to symbolise recent changes in Black popular culture, in particular the shut-down of its political hopes”. Mural of Bob Marley. The desire to change the world through a mixture of reggae and Rastafarianism has been abandoned. Mr Michael Manley, Former Prime Minister of Jamaica 1972-80 & 1989-92 (P.N.P.), talks about the death of Bob Marley and the social developments he had been involved in in the 1970s, and of a society in psychological crisis. Street scenes. Dancers in a club. Commentary says that reggae has retreated into dealing with purely local concerns, and personal image is the only thing over which people have any control. Deejays and rappers now dominate the music which has suffered from musicians’ skills being downgraded by the introduction of new technologies. Musician, Shabba Ranks talking about sound systems. Stone Love, Dancehall Soundsystem. People dancing in club. Commentary says that the transplantation of Jamaican sound systems to New York resulted in hip hop. Harlem, New York. Young women say they believe gangsta rap is influencing young men towards violence. ACE274.3 10:05:46 10:10:27 GUN CULTURE Musician, Ice Cube says that rappers have guns on their album covers (his album Kill at Will) because it’s American culture and that drive-by shooting in America is small scale when compared to what’s going on in Iraq; car-jacking doesn’t compare to “country jacking” when America invades Panama and installs its own government. Bosnia is white on white violence on a bigger scale than black on black. Part of the video of Ice Cube’s Dead Homiez (1990). Writer and Cultural Critic, Professor Cornell West, talking about the issue of nihilism and black culture, reflecting the experiences of poor people and particularly their experience of death. Video of Eazy E and Real Compton City G’s (1993). West on portrayals of nihilism which puts a premium on certain kinds of posing and posturing which, though knowingly ironic, can take on a life of their own with particular consequences. Video of Onyx with Throw Ya Gunz (1993). Musician/Geto Boys, Bushwick Bill. Says that the world is built on gangsterism: all Christopher Columbus’s crew were criminals taken from prisons. More of Throw Ya Gunz.\u000b ACE274.4 10:10:27 10:17:23 Writer and Cultural Critic, Professor Tricia Rose, says rap is playing on stereotypes of black people as marginal, undercover, sexual. However, she suggests that it is often mocking and need not be taken too literally. Musician/Public Enemy, Chuck D, says people treat the music “like a movie”. More of Real Compton City G’s. West compares rappers’ ideas to those of American society generally, “a gun-fighter nation”, which has tried “to gain access to property and power and pleasure by any means”, and talks of “a nihilistic response to a nihilistic situation”. Ranks talking about the violence of Jamaican neighbourhood he grew up in. Street scenes in Jamaica. Kingston Legal Aid Clinic, Florizelle O’Connor, talks about “the power of the gun” in support of political parties which reward their supporters when they get into power. Lawyer, Richard Hart, talking about American response, through the CIA, to Caribbean recognition of Cuba, which set up a political opposition and introduced news weapons into Jamaica. Manley believes that the guns came in in support of drug dealing rather than politics. Ranks says that dancehall performers only talk about guns as they are so common in Jamaican society, but they don’t have any contact with them. Armed guards. O’Connor talking about violence and the use of language which now uses words in completely opposite ways to their original meanings. Video version of Buju Banton’s Boom Bye Bye (Footage courtesy of “The Word”, Planet 24 Ltd., Channel Four TV). O’Connor says that the song “is faithfully recording the attitude of the vast majority of Jamaicans towards homosexuals” as well as faithfully recording the gunshot sounds”. She doesn’t believe that anyone expects the song to incite people to harass homosexuals. ACE274.5 10:17:23 10:26:23 SEX CULTURE The sea with a storm brewing. Commentary says that “bad dreams are turning into violent reality for some but most don’t seem to care”. The gun’s new target is “queers”. Commentary says that Musician, Buju Banton “laughs when asked why feelings of hate animate his songs”. He says his song is not intended to incite anyone but it is “basically a warning”. Musician, Karl Frazer, believes that Banton doesn’t “have the capacity … to really deal with the enormity of the can of worms that he’s opened”. He doesn’t believe that Boom Bye Bye advocates violence even though it says one has the right to kill someone whom one dislikes. More of Boom Bye Bye. Banton, responding to the question of does it incite violence against homosexuals, says that he doesn’t believe songs move people to violence but “there is no way the wicked can ever prosper”. A black gay youth interviewed in Greenwich Village, New York, says the song has caused unnecessary rifts between blacks and whites. Headline from Capital Gay saying “Attacks ‘on the rise’ in south London”. Writer David Dibosa says that his personal experience is that songs like Boom Bye Bye has caused an increase in homophobia, with people even using “gun” gestures against him, and describes an incident in which he and his boyfriend were attacked by a large group of men. Magazine cover suggesting violence against black gays in Brooklyn. Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, New York, Donald Suggs, talks about trying to have Boom Bye Bye countered on radio by more positive messages. Jamaican Tourist Board, Aston Cooke, says the song drew much less criticism in Jamaica because it was considered as “not fit for air play” on radio, and the culture of the dancehall, where the records was heard, is already homophobic. Dancers in club. Frazer talks about how feminine styles have been adopted by dancehall-going men because “there is safety in numbers”. Cooke points out that homosexuality has always been illegal in Jamaica. O’Connor talks about the strong negative public reaction to rumours that this situation might be changed. Director of Programming, Jamaican Broadcasting Corporation, Radio 1 & 2, Gladstone Wilson, believes that, had a pro-change march taken place as planned, there would have been a good deal of violence against the participants. O’Connor talks about how, in the past, men would have been beaten to death if suspected of homosexual contact.\u000b ACE274.6 10:26:23 10:35:31 Banton claims to be “the voice of Jamaica”; commentary says his voice silences others and that, one day, “queer Jamaican voices will have their own song”. University of West Indies. Professor Rex Nettleford, quotes former Prime Minister Edward Seaga as implying that Banton was only “a child” when he wrote Boom Bye Bye. Banton talks about his voice. Commentary suggests that Jamaican culture requires the death of homosexuals in order to maintain its own masculinity. Film Director Ragga Gyal D’bout!, Inge Blackman, says that non-homophobic black fans of ragga are not heard as prominence is to those with homophobic attitudes. She talks about the responses of women she interviewed for her film, angry that given in the mainstream media had “painted the whole of ragga as homophobic”. Dancers in club. O’Connor on finding the anti-woman content of deejay music personally offensive but having to remember the reality it reflects. Musician, Lady Saw, says she is against the anti-woman message of deejay music. Dancers. Lady Saw’s Find a Good Man (1994) heard over. University of West Indies, Carolyn Cooper, says that Lady Saw’s “finding a man” is a “proper sentiment”, but her message about wanting sex is not acceptable. Excerpt from Stab out de Meat (1993) over shot of Dancehall Model, Queen Carlene, arriving at dancehall. Lady Saw talking about the models. Queen Carlene talking about the Dancehall versus Uptown Fashion Clash. Dancers. Cooper talking about the “transgressive” nature of dancehall in which women’s bodies are on display, and which she believes is a positive force. Queen Carlene on self expression. Dancers. Blackman on the importance of ragga culture to black lesbians who are allowed to be sexual with each other in this context. Commentary talks about the contradiction of the celebration of women in dancehall with their dismissal in hip hop. Young women who like hip hop are nevertheless upset by constant references to “bitches and whores”. \u000b ACE274.7 10:35:31 10:42:38 Musician, Money Love, talking about experiences with male musicians in the recording studio. Chuck D saying that language and attitudes stem from the fact that black people have been taught to hate themselves. Musicians/Brand Nubian, Lord Jamar, Sadat X, Sincere: one says that the music “rewards women that do right … and live according to their nature”. Rose suggests that hip hop deals with sex as a means of control; women become “symbols of pseudo-power” in a context which gives the illusion of power. Suggs says that rap’s homophobic and misogynist attitudes are not held by the whole of the black community, and he is concerned that adolescent boys whose views are not thought through are being allowed to speak for that community. Brand Nubian say their song Punks Jump Up to Get Beat Down (1993) is not “gay bashing”. Caption indicates that they refused permission for the video to be included in the film. Suggs talks about the gay community’s response to the record. Young gay black men on a New York Street.

Musician/Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, Michael Franti, talks about the message of the song as being against more than just homophobia. ACE274.8 10:42:38 10:50:43 FAITH Commentary says that Christianity supporting the slave trade as well as being an instrument in the struggle against slavery. Nettleford talks about the strength of Christian faith in Jamaica. Frazer says that though any Jamaican can quote the Bible and that churches are full, he’s not sure that this is a sign of religiosity. Commentary points out that churches in Jamaica are strongly against the decriminalising of homosexuality. Musicians contribute to the debate on how the Bible should be interpreted; commentary quotes Ranks as saying that “God hates homosexuals”. Suggs says that the Jay Lennard Show decided against Ranks’s participation in their programme after his organisation sent a tape of homophobic remarks he’d made. Ranks says he made his statement “to please God Almighty” because he lives by the word of the Bible. Jamaica Council of Churches, Rev. Neville Callam, says that “a few passages of the Old Testament” do not represent the church’s attitude to homosexuals. Commentary quotes Leviticus xviii 22. Unity Fellowship Church, New York, Rev. Jones, points out that “to combine fabrics” as well as tattooing and eating certain foods are also forbidden by Levitical law. West suggests that using the Bible in this way is a way of reinforcing what it means to be black in the late twentieth century, imposing controls over women and homosexuals, and policing those controls. Manley believes that Jamaicans’ past history of slavery, poverty and deprivation can bring out an aggressiveness in self-identification, and “a strong attraction to… a very fundamentalist, escapist religion”.\u000b ACE274.9 10:50:43 10:58:39 Commentary says that the Nation of Islam is a growing force in hip hop, and that Brand Nubian are members of a splinter group, the Five Percent Nation. They say that the role of members of this group is to teach, “to civilise the uncivilised”, and that their philosophy is expounded in their music. West says that while Black Nationalist politics offers positive identity on the one hand, it also reinforces the patriarchal system and is therefore against alternatives such as that of the gay and lesbian lifestyle, as well as purporting to speak for some non-existent homogenous black community. Franti on the importance of their music emphasising the wide variety of black experience. Rose thinks that unlike the possibility for change which fuelled the civil rights movement, hip hop says there is no hope for a better future. West wonders how rappers reconcile their own human need for “care, concern and kindness” with what they project. Jones would like black people “to say Bye Bye” to poverty, crime, hatred, drugs, etc., and become powerful by getting rid of the things that do them harm. Commentary wonders if “something of the violence of slavery has been internalised and lives on in these black musical cultures”. Credit",

VO continues (describing early life) over footage of Martinique, Fanon as doctor in psychiatric hospital. Actuality footage of tanks in street, De Gaulle in triumphant procession in Algiers, some undercut reconstructed footage of Algerians in fear, banana workers. “The struggle between the master and the slave is a struggle for power.” Stuart Hall, writer and cultural critic, on Fanon’s perception of the struggle between coloniser and colonised, the interdependence of master and slave. VO over photograph of agricultural workers: racism prevents recognition of humanity. Reconstructed scenes of the young Fanon listening to music on the radio, intercut with footage of social dancing; mother turns off radio. Françoise Vergès, writer, relating story of Fanon’s mother telling him not to be “like a nigger” in preferring a Creole song to a French song. Photograph of mother. Olivier Fanon (Fanon’s son) talking about his grandmother; he says Fanon had difficulty believing he was his son as he was very light skinned when he was young. Family photographs. Newsreel of commemoration (April 1948) of life of Victor Schoelcher, abolitionist. Beginning of item on Martinique with map showing its location. Footage of Martinique. Vergès’s VO describes the history of the “old colony” which became a French possession before the Revolution. Headless statue of Empress Josephine. Raphaël Confiant, novelist, explains that it was decapitated by Nationalists. More footage on commemorations of abolition of slavery. Vergès’s VO says this did not bring about equality. Young Fanon and the radio. Adult Fanon listening to broadcast about Black Americans fighting for their civil rights. Kléber Gamess, Fanon’s childhood friend, talking about how many young people left Martinique during the Second World War because it was under Vichy government. Joby Fanon, Frantz Fanon’s brother, describes how Fanon left Martinique aged 18, to join the Free French Forces in Dominica. Footage of black soldiers. Mme Felix Fanon, Fanon’s sister-in-law, singing a lullaby; her VO abolition commemoration footage saying that they had their suspicions that Fanon would leave. France-Lyne Fanon, Fanon’s niece, adds that it was dangerous for those who left; they didn’t all reach their destinations. Footage of black soldiers. Reconstruction of Fanon in uniform. Joby Fanon reads from a letter in which Fanon says his decision to fight for France was a mistake as the French peasants didn’t care to fight for themselves.\u000b\u000b ACE311.3 10:09:27 10:16:26 Military cemetery; Paris. Fanon saying “you must understand, dear boy, colour prejudice means absolutely nothing to me”. Joby Fanon on Fanon suggesting that psychiatry can help liberate people from their madness. Fanon actor with further quotations about lack of colour prejudice. Joby Fanon relates how a psychiatric patient refused to let Fanon touch her because he was black. Fanon actor and the response to this from a white doctor. Joby Fanon telling how someone described Fanon as having fireworks outside and fireworks inside. Fanon actor says he found himself an object amongst other objects. VO continues over footage of household objects put onto pavement by firemen; Sartre and De Beauvoir in street. Fanon actor on colour prejudice. Grinning “negro” model advertising toothpaste. Vergès on the writing of Peau noire masques blancs, which Fanon wanted to be his thesis for his medical doctorate. Hall on Fanon’s sudden understanding of the reality of racism which fractures the persona he’s built up for himself, the white mask. Fanon actor “all around me [there’s] a whiteness that burns”. The original title of the book was Essaye pour la dis-alienation de Noir / Essay for the Dis-alienation of the Black. Vergès on the “threat” of the black man. Hall on the sexualised nature of “the look”, discussed for the first time by Fanon. Racism is the denial of the realisation that the white “looker” is attracted to the black “object”. ACE311.4 10:16:26 10:25:55 Chapter three of the book, “The Man of Color and the White Woman”. Vergès suggests that alienation is not caused so much by the desire of the black man for the white woman, but actually the reverse: the white woman desires the black man, as does the homosexual white man, while black women are alienated and desire the white man. The black man is therefore desired by people he doesn’t want and he needs to rid himself of his own desire. Fanon actor watching two black men kissing. Fanon’s words over on lack of proof of existence of homosexuality in Martinique, thus the absence of the Œdipus complex in the Antilles. Photograph of a black transvestite: Fanon’s words says he believes such “godmothers” lead normal sex lives. Hall on “the problematic status of masculinity”, and the possibility to understand Fanon’s ideas of master and slave as a rereading of the Œdipus complex, the struggle between the black son and the colonising father, and suggests that this lies at the root of Fanon’s ambiguity about women and homosexuality. Chapter two of the book, “The Woman of Color and the White Man”. Fanon’s description of Mayotte Capécia’s novel Je suis Martiniquaise (1948), in which the black heroine submits to her white lover in everything, heard over footage of people dancing. Vergès on the context of the novel (partly over photographs of Capécia), commenting on later feminist arguments that he didn’t take this into consideration in his critique. She says Fanon’s argument about who he chooses as his object of desire is that it is no-one’s business but his own. Joby Fanon on being asked why he and Fanon married white women: he also quotes Fanon who is says that, if his children are looked down on, it will be because the world has not changed its ideas. Vergès asks why Fanon should be free to choose but Capécia is not. Joby Fanon on Fanon wanting to leave his work at Pontorson hospital (on the Normandy-Brittany border) in order to work in a country under colonial domination; he went to Blida-Joinville, Algeria, in 1954. Scenes in Algeria. Fanon actor with patients. VO Alice Cherki, psychoanalyst, talking about Pinel freeing patients from their chains in the Salpétrière hospital, and how some people regarded Fanon at Blida as a second Pinel. Jacques Azoulay, psychoanalyst, says there were no chains at Blida anyway; Fanon’s transformation was in freeing the patients from “an ethnographic gaze”. Cherki describes the situation in Fanon’s ward when he arrived at Blida, and how he transformed it by encouraging participation from both the nurses and the patients themselves. ACE311.5 10:25:55 10:33:48 The tanks, helicopter. Cherki on working with Fanon, and VO actual and reconstructed footage of the Algerian war. Reconstruction of Fanon and patient who relates how he learnt that his mother had been killed and his sisters taken away by the military. Film of the war. Reconstruction of Fanon and French soldier explaining what it’s like to torture someone. Film of demonstrations. Reconstruction of Fanon and woman describing hearing people being tortured by her own father. Tanks and troops, etc. Fanon and patient who describes waiting for a woman’s dissident husband, and how she reminded him of his mother. Hall says this was a particularly violent war. Fanon with soldier talking about torture. Film extracts. The two sessions intercut. Cherki says there is a psychoanalytic aspect to violence which can re-open a space for dialogue when language no longer functions. Fanon actor remembers racist remarks about Arabs. Joby Fanon on “social therapy”, developed with Dr Toscelles at St Alban’s hospital in France, which seeks to chance society so that the patient can re-enter it. ACE311.6 10:33:48 10:41:13 Extract from Fanon’s letter of resignation, explaining that Arabs are aliens in their own country. Scenes of warfare; Vergès on Fanon’s feeling that Arabs were more “real” and more masculine that black men from the Antilles as they “had the courage to attack the castrating master”. Fanon’s book Les Damnés de la Terre /The Wretched of the Earth (1961). Hall describes this as “a bible of the de-colonisation moment”, dealing with the problems of national liberation movements. Raphaël Confiant says Martinique was totally brainwashed by the colonists, but Fanon made the people see that they had more in common with people in African countries that with the French. Footage of the 1960 Conference of Independent African States in Leopoldville, with representatives from Ghana, Liberia, Tunisia, Sudan, United Arab Republic, Algeria, etc. Soldiers laying down their weapons. Hall’s VO says that Fanon believed that only armed struggle would produce the right result. Vergès says Fanon wanted to be Algerian as only then could he achieve the masculinity he was dreaming of. Mohammed Harbi, former member of the FLN government, talking about meeting Fanon in Tunis. He feels he was an outsider in respect to general Arab society, and had a strong need for integration. Hall thinks Fanon was opposed to decolonisation (the coloniser handing over to the colonised); he wanted independence (liberty seized by the oppressed) as armed struggle brought self-respect. Harbi talking of Fanon’s support for extreme FLN factions, people like Abane Ramdane and Boumedienne. Hall on Fanon wanting to construct the post-colonial man, with the past wiped entirely away; in Algeria, though, the past has survived and taken its revenge on the present. Hall talking about Fanon’s controversial essay on the veil, pointing out that such symbols are not unchanging as Fanon predicates. Algerian women were able to use the veil to help them smuggle arms as they could depend on the reaction of French soldiers; they could subvert the veil’s meaning and turn “the look” the opposite way. Film extracts. ACE311.7 10:41:13 10:49:35 Harbi says that many people like himself did not approve of Fanon’s “veil” writing, not least because maquis women were discriminated against. Film extracts. Fanon became the mouthpiece by which a patriarchal society was able to present itself as progressive. Hall’s VO says Fanon didn’t recognise the religious nature of Algerian culture, which eventually took its revenge on the revolution itself. Words of Simone de Beauvoir describing Fanon’s illness. Daniel Boukman, poet and playwright, on being drafted at the age of 25 but refused military service. Film of De Gaulle saying that all French soldiers must obey him. Boukman says Fanon’s writings legitimised the actions of the handful of draft objectors, and that he was a revolutionary to the very end. Joby Fanon tries to read a letter from Fanon he received after his death but is too emotional. Reconstructed funeral procession. Algerian women at the polling station. A headstone for Fanon, b 20-7-1925, d 6-12-1961. Joby Fanon reads the letter which reveals that Fanon has leukæmia, and went to Washington for treatment. \u000bOlivier Fanon on the confused and complex situation in Algeria today, which Fanon would never have accepted.

            "desc" : "Chapter three of the book, “The Man of Color and the White Woman”. Vergès suggests that alienation is not caused so much by the desire of the black man for the white woman, but actually the reverse: the white woman desires the black man, as does the homosexual white man, while black women are alienated and desire the white man. The black man is therefore desired by people he doesn’t want and he needs to rid himself of his own desire. Fanon actor watching two black men kissing. Fanon’s words over on lack of proof of existence of homosexuality in Martinique, thus the absence of the Œdipus complex in the Antilles. Photograph of a black transvestite: Fanon’s words says he believes such “godmothers” lead normal sex lives. Hall on “the problematic status of masculinity”, and the possibility to understand Fanon’s ideas of master and slave as a rereading of the Œdipus complex, the struggle between the black son and the colonising father, and suggests that this lies at the root of Fanon’s ambiguity about women and homosexuality. Chapter two of the book, “The Woman of Color and the White Man”. Fanon’s description of Mayotte Capécia’s novel Je suis Martiniquaise (1948), in which the black heroine submits to her white lover in everything, heard over footage of people dancing. Vergès on the context of the novel (partly over photographs of Capécia), commenting on later feminist arguments that he didn’t take this into consideration in his critique. She says Fanon’s argument about who he chooses as his object of desire is that it is no-one’s business but his own. Joby Fanon on being asked why he and Fanon married white women: he also quotes Fanon who is says that, if his children are looked down on, it will be because the world has not changed its ideas. Vergès asks why Fanon should be free to choose but Capécia is not. Joby Fanon on Fanon wanting to leave his work at Pontorson hospital (on the Normandy-Brittany border) in order to work in a country under colonial domination; he went to Blida-Joinville, Algeria, in 1954. Scenes in Algeria. Fanon actor with patients. VO Alice Cherki, psychoanalyst, talking about Pinel freeing patients from their chains in the Salpétrière hospital, and how some people regarded Fanon at Blida as a second Pinel. Jacques Azoulay, psychoanalyst, says there were no chains at Blida anyway; Fanon’s transformation was in freeing the patients from “an ethnographic gaze”. Cherki describes the situation in Fanon’s ward when he arrived at Blida, and how he transformed it by encouraging participation from both the nurses and the patients themselves.",

Tanks and troops, etc. Fanon and patient who describes waiting for a woman’s dissident husband, and how she reminded him of his mother. Hall says this was a particularly violent war. Fanon with soldier talking about torture. Film extracts. The two sessions intercut. Cherki says there is a psychoanalytic aspect to violence which can re-open a space for dialogue when language no longer functions. Fanon actor remembers racist remarks about Arabs.

Scenes of warfare; Vergès on Fanon’s feeling that Arabs were more “real” and more masculine that black men from the Antilles as they “had the courage to attack the castrating master”. Fanon’s book Les Damnés de la Terre /The Wretched of the Earth (1961). Hall describes this as “a bible of the de-colonisation moment”, dealing with the problems of national liberation movements. Raphaël Confiant says Martinique was totally brainwashed by the colonists, but Fanon made the people see that they had more in common with people in African countries that with the French. Footage of the 1960 Conference of Independent African States in Leopoldville, with representatives from Ghana, Liberia, Tunisia, Sudan, United Arab Republic, Algeria, etc. Soldiers laying down their weapons. Hall’s VO says that Fanon believed that only armed struggle would produce the right result. Vergès says Fanon wanted to be Algerian as only then could he achieve the masculinity he was dreaming of. Mohammed Harbi, former member of the FLN government, talking about meeting Fanon in Tunis. He feels he was an outsider in respect to general Arab society, and had a strong need for integration. Hall thinks Fanon was opposed to decolonisation (the coloniser handing over to the colonised); he wanted independence (liberty seized by the oppressed) as armed struggle brought self-respect. Harbi talking of Fanon’s support for extreme FLN factions, people like Abane Ramdane and Boumedienne. Hall on Fanon wanting to construct the post-colonial man, with the past wiped entirely away; in Algeria, though, the past has survived and taken its revenge on the present. Hall talking about Fanon’s controversial essay on the veil, pointing out that such symbols are not unchanging as Fanon predicates. Algerian women were able to use the veil to help them smuggle arms as they could depend on the reaction of French soldiers; they could subvert the veil’s meaning and turn “the look” the opposite way.

Fanon became the mouthpiece by which a patriarchal society was able to present itself as progressive. Hall’s VO says Fanon didn’t recognise the religious nature of Algerian culture, which eventually took its revenge on the revolution itself. Words of Simone de Beauvoir describing Fanon’s illness. Daniel Boukman, poet and playwright, on being drafted at the age of 25 but refused military service. Film of De Gaulle saying that all French soldiers must obey him. Boukman says Fanon’s writings legitimised the actions of the handful of draft objectors, and that he was a revolutionary to the very end. Joby Fanon tries to read a letter from Fanon he received after his death but is too emotional. Reconstructed funeral procession. Algerian women at the polling station. A headstone for Fanon, b 20-7-1925, d 6-12-1961. Joby Fanon reads the letter which reveals that Fanon has leukæmia, and went to Washington for treatment. Olivier Fanon on the confused and complex situation in Algeria today, which Fanon would never have accepted.

VO explains the properties of shellac, runny enough to spray, drip and flick, and drying to a tough finish. VO explains that the most versatile paint of all was invented five hundred years ago.

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE354.2 10:00:00 10:07:05 Lines on paper, buildings, people on a bridge, trains. Commentary: “Perspective is a system artists use to represent three-dimensional space on a flat surface. It relates to the way we actually perceive space and objects within it. For instance, the further away something is from us, the smaller it appears to be, and lines that, in reality, are parallel to each other, appear to converge as they recede into the distance, eventually meeting at an imaginary point on the horizon called the vanishing point.” Florence. Ben Johnson, painter, looking for a particular place in a building. He believes this is “one place of integrity” that existed in the architect’s mind even before the plans of the building, were completed. He takes photographs to work from. Some of Johnson’s paintings, including The Unattended Moment (1993). Johnson and his team working on Hong Kong Panorama (1997). Johnson in his studio, making a computer model of the library in the Museo di San Marco, Florence, which gives him viewpoints otherwise impossible to see. A print-out from his chosen point becomes the basis for his painting; he uses strips of masking tape to follow the lines of the design on the print-out. The result is spray-painted; removing the masking tape reveals the desired pattern. ACE354.3 10:07:05 10:14:26 Commentary explains that true perspective wasn’t employed in painting until the 15th century. Paintings from the early period. Florence where, in 1412, during the Renaissance, a more systematic approach to the representation of space was invented. The Battistero di San Giovanni (Baptistry of Saint John). Reconstruction of the studio of Filippo Brunelleschi who produced a mathematical formula for the reproduction of true perspective. He used the Baptistry as his model for a painting made on a mirror, and was able to switch back and forth between his mirror painting and a view of the building. Ben Johnson photographing Masaccio’s fresco of the Holy Trinity with the Virgin, St John and Two Donors (La Trinità, 1425-1428), painted according to Brunelleschi’s principles. The vanishing point is at the viewer’s eye level. Paintings demonstrating perspective. Johnson with an assistant, checking colours for his library painting. Working on the Hong Kong Panorama which required more than 500 colours. Johnson talks about using warmer colours in the foreground and blue-grey tones for the misty distance. Spraying the San Marco library picture and removing the masking tape strips; the perspective comes from the precision of the technical drawing. Johnson counters criticism that his methods constitute “cheating”. ACE354.4 10:14:26 10:23:44 Optical aids employed by artists over the centuries: a grid of threads, a camera obscura, etc. Canaletto’s Venice: The Upper Reaches of the Grand Canal with S.

It relates to the way we actually perceive space and objects within it. For instance, the further away something is from us, the smaller it appears to be, and lines that, in reality, are parallel to each other, appear to converge as they recede into the distance, eventually meeting at an imaginary point on the horizon called the vanishing point.” Florence. Ben Johnson, painter, looking for a particular place in a building. He believes this is “one place of integrity” that existed in the architect’s mind even before the plans of the building, were completed. He takes photographs to work from. Some of Johnson’s paintings, including The Unattended Moment (1993). Johnson and his team working on Hong Kong Panorama (1997). Johnson in his studio, making a computer model of the library in the Museo di San Marco, Florence, which gives him viewpoints otherwise impossible to see. A print-out from his chosen point becomes the basis for his painting; he uses strips of masking tape to follow the lines of the design on the print-out.

Florence where, in 1412, during the Renaissance, a more systematic approach to the representation of space was invented. The Battistero di San Giovanni (Baptistry of Saint John). Reconstruction of the studio of Filippo Brunelleschi who produced a mathematical formula for the reproduction of true perspective. He used the Baptistry as his model for a painting made on a mirror, and was able to switch back and forth between his mirror painting and a view of the building. Ben Johnson photographing Masaccio’s fresco of the Holy Trinity with the Virgin, St John and Two Donors (La Trinità, 1425-1428), painted according to Brunelleschi’s principles. The vanishing point is at the viewer’s eye level. Paintings demonstrating perspective. Johnson with an assistant, checking colours for his library painting. Working on the Hong Kong Panorama which required more than 500 colours. Johnson talks about using warmer colours in the foreground and blue-grey tones for the misty distance. Spraying the San Marco library picture and removing the masking tape strips; the perspective comes from the precision of the technical drawing.

He arrives at Chatsworth, meets Lord Hartington, son of the present Duke, and unpacks his equipment. They discuss what Hartington will wear; he changes into a suit while Schierenberg sets up. Schierenberg studies his sitter, makes a preliminary impressionistic paint sketch of his face, and talks about how Hartington looks quite different when animated. Painting of Henry VIII by Hans Eworth, deriving from a portrait by Holbein. Reconstruction of Holbein sketching and making notes to work from. Transferring the drawing to a wooden panel by the pouncing technique, pricking holes along the lines, and forcing charcoal powder through them to the wood beneath. Chatsworth.

Images of Muslims at prayer, silk screen picture The Last Supper I, photograph The Crucifixion, road sign for Harlesden, north London, with hoarding displaying the image of the white robed figures. Faisal Abdu’Allah talks about his parents’ reaction to his wish to be an artist. Thalatha Haqq/The Three Truths (1992). Abdu’Allah describes this piece and its symbolism. Other work. Market scenes: his VO talking about each person being a god. Shops: VO talking about cultural changes that he’s seen in Harlesden. Abdu’Allah opening up the barber’s shop where he works. Men having haircuts. Abdu’Allah’s VO saying that his conversations with customers have informed his knowledge of black history and culture. Aqil, from Scientists of Sound, talking about the interaction between their activities and Abdu’Allah’s art. Images from Abdu’Allah’s series, I Wanna Kill Sam Coz He Ain’t My Motherfuckin’ Uncle (1994). His VO describing how he felt rap artists were suffering from stereotyping. Aqil says that the series was Abdu’Allah’s attempt to make people confront their own attitudes and ideas. Martina Attille, film-maker, is concerned that Abdu’Allah’s images are too extreme, at a time when media images of black men are already criminalised. Mark Sealy, Director of Autograph (the Association of Black Photographers), says that while the image of a black man pointing a gun at the camera/viewer is threatening, a similar image of a white man results in James Bond. More images from the series. Aqil and Aybee from Scientists of Soul believe they are popular because, while they deconstruct stereotypes, they are stereotypes. They can be dismissed as “urban art” and not taken as seriously as old masters would be despite their relevance to today’s culture. Cowleaze Wood, Chiltern Sculpture Trail. Abdu’Allah unmoulding a triangular cement pillar. His VO says how hard it is to break away from the classical painting tradition. Superimposed Nick Bodimeade, Chair of Trustees, Chiltern Sculpture Trail, talks about the strong relationship the white middle classes have with landscape and pastoral images. His VO, over Abdu’Allah continuing to construct his installation, suggests that placing images of black men in these surroundings will cause people to question this relationship. ACE365.3 10:08:15 10:15:45 Paul Amey, Artist, advising Abdu’Allah on the best way of putting together his art work, and the perils of vandalism in this outdoor setting. Superimposed Aqil asks why the work isn’t in a gallery in Harlesden, then points out that there is no gallery there and asks if black people would visit it if there was. Aybee and Aqil, superimposed on images of posters and markets from Harlesden, say that most black people have the impression that gallery-goers appreciate a different kind of art to the graffiti and flyers they get themselves, and mock the “cheese and wine” classes. Attille, superimposed on Harlesden street scenes, says that it can be hard, as an artist who relates to the black community, to recognise that that community is as fragmented and changeable as any other, and doesn’t necessarily like to be “spoken … on behalf of”. Harlesden street scenes. Abdu’Allah’s VO suggests that black people in London have been taught a false history which they must question. His piece The Last Supper I, in which the participants are black men and women wearing Muslim robes and veils. Abdu’Allah believes that Western artists have used Christian themes “to their advantage”, with a blond, blue-eyed Jesus offering an image of purity. Abdu’Allah’s photographic piece, The Crucifixion. Aqil on Abdu’Allah’s The Last Supper II, in which the participants are black men and women. Aybee says that the inclusion of the gun helps to draw a parallel with contemporary black society in which blacks may betray others of their own race. Abdu’Allah working on his woodland installation. Details of the work. His VO names it as The Reservoir of Gods, and hopes that viewers will begin to understand what young black men are trying to say. He talks about the challenge of bringing this project to fruition in an environment that he’s not been familiar with before. Harlesden. Photograph of man in robes. Thalatha Haqq. The Last Supper I.

Faisal Abdu’Allah talks about his parents’ reaction to his wish to be an artist. Thalatha Haqq/The Three Truths (1992). Abdu’Allah describes this piece and its symbolism. Other work. Market scenes: his VO talking about each person being a god. Shops: VO talking about cultural changes that he’s seen in Harlesden. Abdu’Allah opening up the barber’s shop where he works. Men having haircuts. Abdu’Allah’s VO saying that his conversations with customers have informed his knowledge of black history and culture. Aqil, from Scientists of Sound, talking about the interaction between their activities and Abdu’Allah’s art. Images from Abdu’Allah’s series, I Wanna Kill Sam Coz He Ain’t My Motherfuckin’ Uncle (1994). His VO describing how he felt rap artists were suffering from stereotyping. Aqil says that the series was Abdu’Allah’s attempt to make people confront their own attitudes and ideas. Martina Attille, film-maker, is concerned that Abdu’Allah’s images are too extreme, at a time when media images of black men are already criminalised. Mark Sealy, Director of Autograph (the Association of Black Photographers), says that while the image of a black man pointing a gun at the camera/viewer is threatening, a similar image of a white man results in James Bond. More images from the series. Aqil and Aybee from Scientists of Soul believe they are popular because, while they deconstruct stereotypes, they are stereotypes. They can be dismissed as “urban art” and not taken as seriously as old masters would be despite their relevance to today’s culture. Cowleaze Wood, Chiltern Sculpture Trail. Abdu’Allah unmoulding a triangular cement pillar. His VO says how hard it is to break away from the classical painting tradition. Superimposed Nick Bodimeade, Chair of Trustees, Chiltern Sculpture Trail, talks about the strong relationship the white middle classes have with landscape and pastoral images. His VO, over Abdu’Allah continuing to construct his installation, suggests that placing images of black men in these surroundings will cause people to question this relationship.",

Superimposed Aqil asks why the work isn’t in a gallery in Harlesden, then points out that there is no gallery there and asks if black people would visit it if there was. Aybee and Aqil, superimposed on images of posters and markets from Harlesden, say that most black people have the impression that gallery-goers appreciate a different kind of art to the graffiti and flyers they get themselves, and mock the “cheese and wine” classes. Attille, superimposed on Harlesden street scenes, says that it can be hard, as an artist who relates to the black community, to recognise that that community is as fragmented and changeable as any other, and doesn’t necessarily like to be “spoken … on behalf of”. Harlesden street scenes. Abdu’Allah’s VO suggests that black people in London have been taught a false history which they must question. His piece The Last Supper I, in which the participants are black men and women wearing Muslim robes and veils.

Aqil on Abdu’Allah’s The Last Supper II, in which the participants are black men and women.

This film is about him – and you.” Multi-screen images. Neon light. An untitled interior landscape (c.1983), yellow corridor with steel tables and chairs. Joseph Kosuth, Artist, talking about Nauman’s work appearing at a time when presumptions of American society, authority, etc., were breaking down, and artists were questioning the “inherited authority” of painting and sculpture, looking for ways to produce art whose meaning could “not be constructed by the forms of the past”.

Nauman would call it his ‘raw material’” says commentary.\u000b\u000bACE368.5 10:30:15 10:40:28 Storr says that a large part of Nauman’s work is about watching people watching it. Sequences from video installation Clown Torture (1987). Some of the Fifteen Pairs of Hands in white bronze (1996).

Merali looking at photographs to find source images for portraiture to convey a political message. His VO talks about the lack of portraiture of Asian and African people. A portrait of his family which tries to illustrate the physical strains caused by their migrations from India to East Africa, to Britain, to Canada. Merali praying. More of Merali’s work. Merali shows his piece, The Hand That Rocked the Cradle, a composition of archive materials illustrating the role of British women in colonialism. Merali teaching at a school. His VO says he’s taking a message, ideas, and the research that went into the work. Merali working at home. He says it is necessary to have the skills to draw black and Asian people properly and to avoid stereotypes. The work of young black artists is currently the only thing that properly documents the presence of black and Asian people in Britain. Credits over examples of batik design",

Rebel MC explaining this as a fusion of hip hop and ragga as he grew up listening to reggae. Gilroy thinks the Afro-centric nature of hip hop is not as new idea in Britain as it was preceded by British reggae and Rastafarian had strong links with an idea of Ethiopian culture. MC Mell’O’ says that rap culture offers an identity in the same way as reggae did in the 1970s. Massop believes that rap has been very important in educating both black and white people. Gilroy suggests that rap is as important as rock and roll in its impact on popular music around the world, and finds it wonderful that this has its roots in African culture.

Gilroy thinks the Afro-centric nature of hip hop is not as new idea in Britain as it was preceded by British reggae and Rastafarian had strong links with an idea of Ethiopian culture. MC Mell’O’ says that rap culture offers an identity in the same way as reggae did in the 1970s. Massop believes that rap has been very important in educating both black and white people. Gilroy suggests that rap is as important as rock and roll in its impact on popular music around the world, and finds it wonderful that this has its roots in African culture.

He is saddened that so few people are aware of their musical heritage. Caption: “Aziz also leads Britain’s first and only BTEC in Asian Music.” Class learning rhythm. Zeria hopes that this course will enable the study of Asian music and other Asian cultural traditions. 2 Phaan [Phaaan] the Alien, The Kalifs [Kaliphz] Group, says Asian people in Britain didn’t have Asian role models to offer them images of “aggressiveness”, needed to help them survive in the culture they’re living in. He thinks that hip hop became popular with Asians because it was the first music “to show a bit of anger”. The Kalifs. 2 Phaaan thinks that most people’s access to any progressive post-colonial music is limited; Indian cinema is a relic of colonial cinema and doesn’t relate to the experiences of young people of Asian origin.

Other articles headlining them as “hard core rap”. 2 Phaaan wants the group to be known for its music, not because of its racial mix. Radical Sistah, the KKKings [KK Kings] Group, says their musicians grew up with a wide variety of musical styles, all reflected in their work, though some of it does contain more recognisable traditional Asian sounds. Mikha K, the KKKings Group, believes that the Indian traditional will inevitably “be watered down”. Radical Sistah believes that they are all very aware of their musical heritage, but thinks that it requires investment by “people in power” to ensure that younger people all know and understand those traditions. Mikha K thinks that large record companies recognise the need to sponsor Asian groups in order to reach the Asian market which will mean the growth of the new music as well. The father’s instruments. Discordant musical sounds form into a traditional-style piece. Credits.",

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE438.2 10:00:00 10:10:47 Map showing islands in the Caribbean. Commentary talks about the results of colonisation on the indigenous populations and on people of African descent, and introduces Dr Edward Kamau Brathwaite to discuss “the erasure of African history from the textbooks of his childhood education”. Brathwaite VO explains, over films of drummers and Zulu warriors, that his Barbadian upbringing gave him no idea of the realities of African life. George Lamming, Novelist, says that West Indian high schools “siphoned off a minority of people who would later function as a kind of buffer group between the colonial power and the broad base of the population”. Caption: “Part One. On Colonization.” Linton Kwesi Johnson, poet, talks about how poets develop their own styles, usually first reading the work of earlier generations. He wonders if he is really a poet as he didn’t do this: he only read what he had to learn for GCSE exams in Jamaica. Prof. John Figueroa says that the culture and heritage of places like Caribbean countries is always mediated by Europeans who were responsible for taking Africans there, and illustrates this by reference to George Lamming’s Season of Adventure (1960). Lamming suggests that the elementary school curriculum was intended to train children to be loyal to the colonising power and “to be an agent of social control”. Newsreels of official functions, parades, etc. Film of West Indian schoolroom. Kamau Brathwaite on education in Barbados where they were taught English history and literature to encourage them to be “good colonials”. He talks about pupils taking advantage of teacher shortage to educate themselves in “Modern Studies” and bring in texts which gave them information about the achievements and situation of black people elsewhere in the world, and about discovering Barbadian folk culture. Film of banana harvest. Roy Heath, novelist, on developing a dual consciousness under colonialism, with part of that being “foisted” on him. As an example, he compares Gothic and Islamic architecture, saying that West Indians have accepted the colonist liking for Gothic buildings but they are actually far less attractive than Islamic ones. He realises how important – in a negative way – was the imposition of colonial ideas on him. ACE438.3 10:10:47 10:21:15 Lamming reading from The Honorable Member (1981) at the Caribbean Writers’ Conference, Commonwealth Institute, October 1986, emphasising the importance of proper education. Heath questions the validity of people adhering to a religion used to suppress them. Commentary mentions the novels Genetha (1981) and Orealla (1984) as examining such issues. Heath talking about the “red skin” middle class in Guyana, an object of both respect and hatred for the working class, how self-education helps some of his characters, and how revolutionaries often forget their ideals when they become middle class themselves. Sea; Grace Nichols on the beach. Nichols reading from I is a Long-Memoried Woman (1983), winner of the Commonwealth Poetry Prize, over. ACE438.4 10:21:15 10:30:16 Caption: “Part Two. The Settlers.” Lamming talking about migration, “not a literary matter” but part of a widespread population movement. Figueroa talks about coming to Britain in August 1946, the people he met on the boat, working with the radio series “Caribbean Voices”, and giving public readings. Lamming on the people he met on the boat on which he came to Britain and the expectations they had. Figueroa on the post-war situation in Britain – no street lighting, strict rationing – and on the few publications available, Bim, and Kyk Over Al. Lamming on the importance of “Caribbean Voices” paying for material, and the way it encouraged people to contribute or to read for broadcast. He says his fees from the series enabled him to write In the Castle of My Skin (1953). Figueroa thinks that the response to Caribbean authors’ work at that time over-inflated their reputations – examples of the books. Kamau Brathwaite says that British critics were unable to get to grips with Caribbean writing; they promoted people of whom they approved but who did not necessarily reflect the complexities of the Caribbean experience.\u000b ACE438.5 10:30:16 10:39:47 Figueroa on V S Naipaul, on cross-cultural problems, and on the ignorance of the British as regards Caribbean writing at the time. Traffic in fog. VO of Samuel Selvon reading from The Lonely Londoners (1956). Selvon reading. He talks about the book which he says accurately describes his own experiences or those of his close friends. Lamming on The Lonely Londoners and other writing, saying that the central preoccupation of such work is less to do with Britain than with exploring the unique experience of the Caribbean. Kamau Brathwaite says Caribbean man is “a quester”, with “both root and outreach”, but there is not enough connection between what’s happening in the Caribbean and what’s going on in Britain. Lamming on the West Indian “regional consciousness”. Commentary (over film of Caribbean scenes) explains that Kamau Brathwaite’s desire for a sense of community encouraged him to co-found the Caribbean Artists’ Movement in 1966. Kamau Brathwaite talks of this lack of community in Britain compared to Africa or the West Indies, and on the aims of CAM, primarily to help writers meet each other and learn about each others’ work, and also to try to have some influence on publishers. ACE438.6 10:39:47 10:49:31 Caption: “Part Three. Language & Orality.”\u000bStreet demonstration. Commentary talks about Selvon’s striving for authenticity. He says he has never lost his birthright; he was never “Indianised” in Trindad, a “creolised” society. Street demonstration. Commentary on Heath’s authenticity and his belief that language is an important component of culture. Heath talks about the relative importance of language and other aspects of cultural affinity. Street demonstration. Commentary talks about Johnson’s work being influenced by reggae deejays. He talks about his college paper on Jamaican rebel music, and of some of the performers whose work and politics he admired. Street market; drinkers in a pub. VO Mark Matthew reading “I am sitting with Pilot in a Notting Hill Gate cider bar…”, an early experience of London dominated by thoughts of Guyana. Grace Nichols on using her experience of exile in her writing. \u000b ACE438.7 10:49:31 10:54:47 Johnson says he and people like him are fortunate to have two languages, the European one and the one created out of the slave experience, which makes the Caribbean poetic vision broader. Heath says England has no meaning for him. Children in park play area. VO of Netifa Masimba, poet, who says her work is written for children who have no sense of community spirit or guidance; adults need to address this. She reads to some children from A Woman Determined (1987). Credits.",

            "desc" : "Map showing islands in the Caribbean. Commentary talks about the results of colonisation on the indigenous populations and on people of African descent, and introduces Dr Edward Kamau Brathwaite to discuss “the erasure of African history from the textbooks of his childhood education”. Brathwaite VO explains, over films of drummers and Zulu warriors, that his Barbadian upbringing gave him no idea of the realities of African life. George Lamming, Novelist, says that West Indian high schools “siphoned off a minority of people who would later function as a kind of buffer group between the colonial power and the broad base of the population”. Caption: “Part One. On Colonization.” Linton Kwesi Johnson, poet, talks about how poets develop their own styles, usually first reading the work of earlier generations. He wonders if he is really a poet as he didn’t do this: he only read what he had to learn for GCSE exams in Jamaica. Prof. John Figueroa says that the culture and heritage of places like Caribbean countries is always mediated by Europeans who were responsible for taking Africans there, and illustrates this by reference to George Lamming’s Season of Adventure (1960). Lamming suggests that the elementary school curriculum was intended to train children to be loyal to the colonising power and “to be an agent of social control”. Newsreels of official functions, parades, etc. Film of West Indian schoolroom. Kamau Brathwaite on education in Barbados where they were taught English history and literature to encourage them to be “good colonials”. He talks about pupils taking advantage of teacher shortage to educate themselves in “Modern Studies” and bring in texts which gave them information about the achievements and situation of black people elsewhere in the world, and about discovering Barbadian folk culture. Film of banana harvest. Roy Heath, novelist, on developing a dual consciousness under colonialism, with part of that being “foisted” on him. As an example, he compares Gothic and Islamic architecture, saying that West Indians have accepted the colonist liking for Gothic buildings but they are actually far less attractive than Islamic ones. He realises how important – in a negative way – was the imposition of colonial ideas on him.",

Figueroa talks about coming to Britain in August 1946, the people he met on the boat, working with the radio series “Caribbean Voices”, and giving public readings. Lamming on the people he met on the boat on which he came to Britain and the expectations they had. Figueroa on the post-war situation in Britain – no street lighting, strict rationing – and on the few publications available, Bim, and Kyk Over Al. Lamming on the importance of “Caribbean Voices” paying for material, and the way it encouraged people to contribute or to read for broadcast. He says his fees from the series enabled him to write In the Castle of My Skin (1953). Figueroa thinks that the response to Caribbean authors’ work at that time over-inflated their reputations – examples of the books. Kamau Brathwaite says that British critics were unable to get to grips with Caribbean writing; they promoted people of whom they approved but who did not necessarily reflect the complexities of the Caribbean experience.",

Lamming on The Lonely Londoners and other writing, saying that the central preoccupation of such work is less to do with Britain than with exploring the unique experience of the Caribbean. Kamau Brathwaite says Caribbean man is “a quester”, with “both root and outreach”, but there is not enough connection between what’s happening in the Caribbean and what’s going on in Britain. Lamming on the West Indian “regional consciousness”. Commentary (over film of Caribbean scenes) explains that Kamau Brathwaite’s desire for a sense of community encouraged him to co-found the Caribbean Artists’ Movement in 1966. Kamau Brathwaite talks of this lack of community in Britain compared to Africa or the West Indies, and on the aims of CAM, primarily to help writers meet each other and learn about each others’ work, and also to try to have some influence on publishers.",

      "Full synopsis" : "ACE462.2 10:00:00 10:09:28 Photograph of Walter Sickert (1860-1942) around 1930, “one of the outstanding British painters of his time”. Islington Public Library (Holloway Road): an early portrait of Sickert, a librarian going through part of collection of materials made by Sickert’s Trustees: books of cuttings, a palette, a copper plate and etching, magazines and illustrations, advertisements for some of his classes, manuscript. Photograph of wooden figure being carried upstairs and a painting suggested by it, Lazarus Raised from the Dead. Wooden lay figure, which Sickert believed had once belonged to William Hogarth. Carved wooden figures of troupe of seventeenth-century Italian actors. Portrait of Sickert. Photograph of Sickert with French painter. Photographs of Sickert. Catalogue of painting by his Danish father and grandfather. Self Portrait (c.1840s) by his father, Oswald; Sickert’s description of him over. Portrait of his mother, Eleanor (Ellen) Louisa Moravia. Early film of street scenes round Piccadilly Circus. Drawing of life class: Sickert’s early desire to become an actor soon gave way to an urge to paint; he became the pupil of James Whistler (portrait). Whistler’s sketch of Sickert when his assistant. Typical paintings of the period: Frank Bramley’s A Hopeless Dawn (1888), J P G Pettie’s Two Strings to Her Bow (1882), Chatterton by Henry Wallis (1856), another. Paintings by Whistler including The Lady of the Lang Lijsen (1864) and three “typical portraits”; three early pictures by Sickert “almost identical” to these. Picture of Whistler with Arrangement in Grey and Black (aka Whistler’s Mother, 1871), which Sickert took to Paris for him. Sketch by Sickert, “said to be” a portrait of Edgar Degas. Picture by Degas, Six Friends at Dieppe (1885), one of whom is Sickert. Commentary says that “many of Degas’s paintings have qualities that suggest Sickert’s approach to his own work”: The Millinery Shop (c.1884-1890), Waiting: Dancer and Woman with Umbrella (c.1882), The Rape / Le Viol (1868-1869). Sickert’s work shows clear influence of Degas and the French school which “freed him from Whistler’s mannerisms: examples. Photograph of Sickert. Footage of Venice, “one of the main centres of the European tradition of painting”. Early Venetian pictures by Sickert: views of San Giorgio Maggiore, Santa Maria della Salute, Rialto Bridge, etc. Another painting of Santa Maria della Salute of a type which Sickert later called “façade painting”. Other paintings of Venetian scenes. Sketch and paintings of St. Mark’s, Venice (Pax Tibi Marce Evangelista Meus) (c.1896). Two Women on a Sofa: Le Tose (c.1903-1904). Portraits of model La Giuseppina and her mother (called by Sickert “Mama Mia Poveretta”). La Giuseppina against a Map of Venice (1903-1904). Other paintings. ACE462.3 10:09:28 10:09:51 END OF FIRST REEL ACE462.4 10:09:51 10:19:23 The beach at Dieppe; views of the harbour and market, etc. Paintings by Sickert intercut with street scenes, including Café des Tribunaux, Dieppe (1890); painting in which, as in others, Sickert “explored the deep shadows of the buildings and the play of light on their walls and roofs”. Other paintings including Bathers, Dieppe (1902) and The Façade, St Jacques, Dieppe (1899-1900). Portrait of Victor Lecour (1922-1924), also a study in light; Sickert’s description of the picture quoted over. “More dramatic pictures”: sketches and paintings from the 1920s. Trains; buildings in Camden Town and Islington; Hampstead Road: statue of Richard Cobden, father of Sickert’s first wife, Ellen; more street and canal scenes: The Hanging Gardens of Islington (1929). Photograph of Sickert in one of his studios c.1930; the studio today; outside the building. Exterior the Marquess Tavern. Sign for Sickert Court; council housing blocks. Street scenes in Camden Town. A room which “was once his study”. Commentary suggests that Sickert’s choice of run-down locations for studio and living spaces was part of a search for “real life”. Sketches and paintings including Mornington Crescent nude, contre-jour (1907).

Early film of street scenes round Piccadilly Circus. Drawing of life class: Sickert’s early desire to become an actor soon gave way to an urge to paint; he became the pupil of James Whistler (portrait). Whistler’s sketch of Sickert when his assistant. Typical paintings of the period: Frank Bramley’s A Hopeless Dawn (1888), J P G Pettie’s Two Strings to Her Bow (1882), Chatterton by Henry Wallis (1856), another.

Picture by Degas, Six Friends at Dieppe (1885), one of whom is Sickert. Commentary says that “many of Degas’s paintings have qualities that suggest Sickert’s approach to his own work”: The Millinery Shop (c.1884-1890), Waiting: Dancer and Woman with Umbrella (c.1882), The Rape / Le Viol (1868-1869). Sickert’s work shows clear influence of Degas and the French school which “freed him from Whistler’s mannerisms: examples. Photograph of Sickert. Footage of Venice, “one of the main centres of the European tradition of painting”. Early Venetian pictures by Sickert: views of San Giorgio Maggiore, Santa Maria della Salute, Rialto Bridge, etc. Another painting of Santa Maria della Salute of a type which Sickert later called “façade painting”.
