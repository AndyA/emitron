A painting which Rubens gave to Charles, Minerva Protects Pax from Mars (Peace and War) (1629-1630); Martin talks about details of the painting in which Rubens used “a vocabulary of allegory and symbol … common to everybody that was educated in the classical tradition”, explaining that Minerva personified wisdom, Hercules could personify strength, etc. He suggests that Rubens wanted to say to Charles that, as a wise man, he would favour peace over war, but did it in a way which had “drama … impact and relevance”. Part of Rubens’s Landscape with St George and the Dragon (1629-1635) with Charles I as the Saint and Queen Henrietta Maria as the princess. Martin points out that the picture also shows the Thames and Lambeth Palace. Rubens’s oil sketch of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham (1625). Painting, Minerva and Mercury conduct the Duke of Buckingham to the Temple of Virtue (c.1625).

The Peaceful Reign of James I (aka The Benefits of the Reign of James I), with Minerva repulsing Mars while James embraces Concord and Peace. The Union of the Crowns, in which James directs Minerva to present the crowns of England and Scotland to Charles I, while Hercules overcomes Evil.

Self portrait c.1638-1640. Details of paintings. Martin points out that there were very few working drawings but many oil sketches, probably used by studio assistants to help them in blocking in the large canvases while Rubens went over them later. The paintings were delivered and installed in 1635. Rubens’s painting, An Autumn Landscape with a View of Het Steen in the Early Morning (c.1636), of his country house at Elewijt, where he spent most of his last year before his death in 1640. Self Portrait. Edward Bower’s portrait of Charles I at His Trial (1648). Engraving of crowds. Engraving of Oliver Cromwell with head of executed king; Cromwell’s signature on execution order. Engraving of scenes at execution. Banqueting Hall where the paintings “express the highest aspirations of the early Stuarts and are also the silent witnesses to the collapse of those aspirations”.
