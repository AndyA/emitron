Ballroom dancing patterns with feet and lines. Dancers, one with no legs, moving on and over the patterns. Woman in wheelchair trying to attract attention of man who refuses to see her. All dancers interacting with each other. Legless man and another performing similar movements. Woman seeming to dance in the sky. Man in wheelchair contemplating painting which turns into faces, including his own. Other dancers performing tango. . One of them peels back grass to see the faces underneath it. A “smoke and mirrors” effect; dancers together. Final shot of them making tracks across a giant sand fingerprint and countryside. Credits.",
