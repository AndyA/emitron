   "Full synopsis" : "ACE398.2 10:00:00 10:09:33 Two men dress in shorts and trainers, each picks up a pole, and they start to walk across the Wadden Sea. One starts wading into water. The other follows reluctantly. Back in the mud. They throw away their poles and carry on walking, one getting well ahead of the other. Night. The slower man, now waist-high in water, has lost his companion. The other man in deep water, looking for his friend. Daylight. The second man sees his slower friend floating in the water and begins to carry him to shore. The other starts to fight him. The rescuer collapses exhausted in the shallows; the other walks away.
