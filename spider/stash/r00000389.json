People burst up from under the dried surface. Man and woman dancing. Woman disappears upwards into the sky. Red-painted women and men. Man ringing the sides of his bowl. More dancers come from under the earth. More drips. Blue man pulling rock. Red and yellow dancers surround blue man with bowl who levitates on top of the rock. Rocks floating up on ropes. Dancers trying to keep their feet. Water runs up from bowl. In the water sky, legs hang down while water drips upwards. Credits.",
