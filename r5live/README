In a tmux or screen window run

$ jackd -d firewire

And then in another window

$ perl r5live.pl

The configuration is in the source of r5live.pl. The jack mappings can
be set up in the 'apogee' section of the config. Find channels to
connect to using:

$ jack_lsp -A

The indented alias name is the one to use.
