BUGS

  Can't restart with an existing database. Suspect something to do with
  Moose being lazy. Or maybe...

  Above problem may be because we don't always die cleanly. Why is that?
  The fact that the HLS packager worker doesn't die (and is the subject
  of the warning about not being killed) also causes us to run out of
  inotify handles after a few packaging jobs.

  Maybe making PipeFork cleanly stackable - so INT/TERM propagate to all
  children is the way forward.

  Encoding artefacts:

    Where are the coming from? Don't look like B-frame related problems
    - the ordering is OK.

  Playback:

    Even from the h264 webcam playback starts to freeze after a while
    (double check).

    Video from The Space started stalling every segment after a
    few hours.

Push fragments to S3.

Make encoders run in (NTP) sync: DTS/PTS/GoP
