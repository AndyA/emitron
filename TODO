BUGS

  Can't restart with an existing database. Suspect something to do with
  Moose being lazy. Or maybe...

  Above problem may be because we don't always die cleanly. Why is that?
  The fact that the HLS packager worker doesn't die (and is the subject
  of the warning about not being killed) also causes us to run out of
  inotify handles after a few packaging jobs.

  Maybe making PipeFork cleanly stackable - so INT/TERM propagate to all
  children is the way forward.

  Playback:

    Even from the h264 webcam playback starts to freeze after a while
    (double check).

    Video from The Space started stalling every segment after a
    few hours.

Push fragments to S3.

Log to file as well as console.

Make ForkPipe commit infanticide reliably.

Wire up ForkPipe and use it to get async notifications from packager.

Integrate switcher / router.

Fix up DTS/PTS in router: global clock.

What happens when an m3u8 transitions from EVENT -> VOD during playback?

More verbs in Emitron::Core
  Stream switching
    Slate / preroll / multiple sources

Make encoders run in (NTP) sync: DTS/PTS/GoP

VOD capture?
  Logging?

Authentication / authorisation
  How do we handle that for incoming RTMP?

SSL for web app.

Make webapp run under Apache.
