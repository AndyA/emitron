BUGS

  Can't restart with an existing database. Suspect something to do with
  Moose being lazy.

  Lots of model updates with no change to the data.
    - find bug
    - only commit change if diff? Seems sensible because committing a
      non-differing change causes diffs to happen elsewhere.

  Worry about messages being stalled in a particular worker's input pipe
  while the worker handles an event or model change. The busy lock on
  message processing stops the queue from flooding but doesn't prevent a
  single message from stalling.
