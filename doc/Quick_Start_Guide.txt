----------------------------------------------
------------  INSTALLATION  ------------------
----------------------------------------------
For all distributions, simply un-compress the distribution to install.
The location of the installation is not important. However, for safety, 
the EvoStream Media Server should NOT be installed into the web-root 
of the target computer.

The EvoStream Media Server distribution includes a collection of folders:
bin/ : For Non-Windows distributions, the bin folder contains the Media Server 
	executable, run scripts and License file.
  For Windows distributions, the bin/ folder is not provided.  The 
	executables and run scripts can be found in the main distribution
	folder. The License file can be found in the config/ folder.


config/ : The config directory contains all of the configuration files
	that are required to run the Media Server.  The Media Server
	will also create some files at runtime. Those files will also be
	placed into this directory.
	Some files of note:
		License.lic : The server license (for Windows distributions)
		config.lua : The primary configuration file for the Media 
				Server.  This file is typically passed as a
				parameter when starting the Media Server.
		users.lua : Contains the authentication lookups for RTSP and 
				RTMP authentication.
		pushPullSetup.xml : Generated at runtime, this file contains
				all of the streams that have been created 
				using the Media Server pullStream and 
				pushStream commands.  Any streams that are 
				described in this file will be re-connected 
				when the Media Server starts.

doc/ : The doc directory contains the EvoStream Media Server documentation

media/ : The media directory is the default location for video-on-demand
		files.  This is where the Media Server will look for
		when VOD requests are made.  This default location can be
		changed in the Media Server's main configuration file which
		is typically config/config.lua

runtime_api/ : Provides PHP and JavaScript wrappers for the EvoStream
		Media Server Runtime API. See doc/API Definition.pdf for
		more information on the runtime API.


----------------------------------------------
------------  SERVER STARTUP  ----------------
----------------------------------------------

--- LINUX, MAC OSX, and BSD DISTRIBUTIONS ----
There are two run scripts that can be used to start the EvoStream Media
Server:
	run_console.sh : Simply runs the Media Server inline, using 
			config/config.lua as the main server configuration

	run_daemon.sh : Runs the EvoStream Media Server as a background
			process.  The script will attempt to assign the
			run-process to the user "evostream".

Both commands can be directly executed:
	MyPrompt$ ./run_console.sh
	MyPrompt$ ./run_daemon.sh


*Important Notes:  
	1) For run_daemon.sh, if the "evostream" user does not exist, an
	error will be printed to the screen.  Despite the error, the Media
	Server will probably have been started. To check if the server is 
	running, you can issue the following command:
	ps -e | grep evo
	If a line is printed that starts with ./evostreamms, the server is
	running.
	2) The user used by run_daemon.sh can easily be modified by changing
	the value after the "-u" in the script itself.
	3) The user running the EvoStream Media Server must have sufficient
	permission to open and bind to network ports


---------- WINDOWS DISTRIBUTIONS -------------

For Windows distributions, there is a run script for running the server in a command prompt:
	run.bat : This script simply runs the Media Server inline, using 
			config/config.lua as the main server configuration
	
There are several other scripts that can be used to create and manipulate the server as a 
Windows Service. These scripts need to be run as an administrator. You can verify they have
worked by opening the Windows Services tool and looking for the EvoStreamMediaServer service.
	WinService-Create.bat : Creates and starts the Windows service
	WinService-Remove.bat : Removes the Windows service
	WinService-Start.bat : Starts the service if it has not already been started
	WinService-Stop.bat : Stops the service if it is currently running
	srvany.exe : This is a binary provided by Microsoft for installing programs as services.
