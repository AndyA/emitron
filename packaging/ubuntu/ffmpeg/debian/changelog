libav (6:0.8.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]
  * Bug fix: "Multi-Arch: foreign libraries", thanks to Stepan Golosunov.
    Make the transitional libavfoo-extra-NN packages 'arch: all' and
    remove the 'Multi-Arch: foreign' fields to avoid that the dependency
    can be satisfied by packages of other architectures, which would break
    applications. Closes: #680613
  * Make libav-extra-dbg 'arch: all'.  As empty, transitional package
    without strict dependencies, we can safely ship it as arch:all
    package.

  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * Mention qt-faststart in the long description (Closes: #681491).
  * Install all debug symbols into libav-dbg (Closes: #680602).
  * Do not run doxygen if it is not installed. This does not change anything
    for regular builds, but helps with bootstrapping the package to new
    architectures that may not have doxygen available yet.
  * Fix up debian/changelog and tighten dependencies.
  * Do not declare "ffmpeg" as virtual package (provided by libav-tools).
    Instead, we provide it as transitional package for libav-tools. Note
    the next upstream version will no longer provide neither an 'ffmpeg'
    package, nor a /usr/bin/ffmpeg binary. This means that front-end
    applications in Debian that previously used this binary needs to be
    ported to /usr/bin/avconv for jessie.

  * New Upstream Version (svn revision 16978 libswscale revision 28461)

  Upstream Changes:
    - R3D REDCODE demuxer
    - ALSA support for playback and record

  * strighten internal dependencies by using a shlibs.local file
    Closes: #512844, #512466
  * New upstream version reintroduces a compatibility symbol ff_gcd
    Closes: #512946
  * Bump shlibs because of changes of the Metadata API in libavformat.
    Actually no other package should use them yet, but let's better play safe
    here...
  * no longer install dsputil.h. It exposes lots of function that are private
    to ffmpeg and may change on any new upstream revision. Please get in touch
    with the ffmpeg maintainers if you maintain packages that rely on that
    ffmpeg internal headers like this.
  * simplify debian/confflags by doing autodetection of headers:
     - xvid.h
     - lame/lame.h
     - faac.h
     - x264.h
     - vdpau/vdpau.h
    Also remove the setting externalcodecs from DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. The codecs
    will be enabled as soon as the headers are installed on the filesystem,
    so there is no need in enabling that separately.
  * install ffpresets in /usr/share/ffmpeg/. Currently only presets for
    x264 are avaiable, so a libx264 enabled libavcodec (like
    libavcodec-unstripped-52) is needed to actually use them.

  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * Enabled Speex decoding via libspeex.
  * Use an alternative approach to achieve strict internal dependencies
    by calling dh_makeshlibs twice in debian/rules instead of a
    debian/shlibs.local file.

    please file bugs to request them.
  * rename the source package (again), this time on upstream's request.
    The former name was considered insulting by upstream, because it
    somewhat indicated the original source was somehow 'non-free', which is
    not the case. The new name now represents that we modified the package

  [ Reinhard Tartler ]

  * remove patches from the debian package as disussed with upstream:
    - 005_runtime_cpudetect.diff: it is supposed to fix runtime cpu detection
      on i386. The code (and the define) has undergone large refactoring wrt.
      the define RUNTIME_CPUDETECT. It is very likely to have undisired
      side-effects with this version of ffmpeg. It therefore seem more safe
      to me to actually remove this patch for now, and reinvestigate the
      problems that occur, if they do.  (Related to: #482717)
    - 005_m68k_workaround.diff: works around bugs in gcc for m68k.
    - 006_mips_pthreads.diff: was an workaround for (now fixed) #428741.
    - 020_fix_sws_scale_crash: patch has been rejected upstream:
      http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2008-May/047846.html
    - 054_h264_mmx_chroma_mc_crash.diff. According to upstream, this has
      been fixed in a different way and is not reproducible. Verified that
      the file referenced in bug #404176 does not crash anymore even
      without this patch.
  * new patch: 015_reenable-img_convert.diff.  Unlike previous version of this
    patch, this uses a more lightweight approach. With building imgresample, a
    few symbol clashes occur with libswscale. We therefore strip off symbols
    that are already provided by libswscale. (Closes: #483960).
  * remove 011_link_plugins.diff. It is completely unnecessary now.
  * refactor quilt usage: use /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make.
  * support building in paralell. make snippet taken from the qemu package.
  * cleanups in debian/rules.
  * Move ffmpeg-config back to libavutil. This way we can avoid a circular
    dependency between libavutil-dev and libavcodec-dev. (Closes: #484132).
    libavcodec uses libavutil internally, so this dependency cannot be avoided.
  * disable altivec, at least for now. (Closes: #482717)
  * always compile with --disable-strip. We strip the binaries afterwards using
    dh_strip anyways.
  * Remove depdency substitutions ${shlibs:Depends} and ${misc:Depends} from the

  [ Fabian Greffrath ]
  * debian/control:
    + Added libx11-dev and libxext-dev to Build-Depends.
  * debian/rules:
    + Build with --enable-x11grab (Closes: #441983).
    + Build ffmpeg and shared libraries with --extra-cflags="-fPIC -DPIC"
      (feeling confident that this closes: #472613) and "drop the surgery
      regarding Makefile.pic and config.mak.pic".
    + In this context, cleaned up build rule: Run '$(MAKE)' and '$(MAKE) clean'
      from the top source directory instead of diving into the library
      directories; force move during backup and recovery of the static
      libraries; let the build rule itself depend on config-extra-includes.h
      (instead of build-stamp) to avoid being run again from the binary rule;
      some more minor changes of cosmetic type.
    + Renamed config-extra-includes rule to config-extra-includes.h to
      reflect the file name of the created file (also changed to override it
      instead of appending) and to avoid the rule to be run twice.
    + Disabled all architecture-specific optimizations for the time being.
