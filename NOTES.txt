Config
======

The only bootstrap config we should need should be the name of a
directory to contain the various databases. That plus the built-in
config defaults should be enough to get us running.

Perhaps we should just have an env variable called EMITRON_HOME and have
it default to /tmp/emitron.

Any config that we push to crtmpserver should be idempotent so we can
always push config at startup / as often as we like.

Roles
=====

  Message sink
    Receives messages
    Only available in worker context
    Where does polling happen?

  Event sink
    Receives events
    Anything can be an event sink.

  Message source
    Sends messages
    Anything should be able to send messages
    But the implementation will depend on whether we're running in a
    worker (in which case we have to use IPC) or the master (in
    which case we can post messages directly into the queue).

  Event source
    Sends events
    Anything can send events

To determine at runtime whether we're running in the master or a worker
we can just set a global in the forked workers.

Make the master queue runner a singleton - so we can find it to send
messages when we're running in the master.

  Emitron Core
    Is an event and message source that wraps messages in various domain
    specific verbs (encode_start, encode_stop etc).
