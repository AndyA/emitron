Fat Cat
===========

Fat Cat (fatcat) is a combination of cat, buffer and tee. It accepts
input from a single source, buffers it in memory and distributes it to
one or more destinations.

At its simplest it behaves like cat:

  $ ls | fatcat | sort  # is just like...
  $ ls | cat | sort     # ...this

Unlike cat (and like tee) any named parameters are files to output to:

  $ cat somefile | fatcat other1 other2

behaves like

  $ cat somefile | tee other1 other2 > /dev/null

Note that when outputting to a file or files output to stdout is
disabled.

An input can be named like this:

  $ fatcat -i somefile other1 other2

By default a 1MB buffer is allocated. This can be overridden using the -b option:

  $ fatcat -b 100MB
